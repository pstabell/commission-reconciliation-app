# Formula Issue Analysis
**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Issue**: Formulas not calculating correctly in Edit Policies form

## Problem Summary

User reported that when editing Collins Telecom (Transaction ID: OO46MPG):
- Premium Sold: $5,165.00
- Policy Gross Comm %: 7.00
- Agent Comm (NEW 50% RWL 25%): 0.50 (this is the issue - stored as decimal not percentage)
- Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM): $361.55 (should be auto-calculated)
- Agent Estimated Comm $: $1.81 (should be auto-calculated)

## Expected Calculations

1. **Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)**:
   - Formula: $5,165.00 × 7% = $361.55 ✓ (This is actually correct!)

2. **Agent Estimated Comm $**:
   - Formula: $361.55 × 50% = $180.78 (NOT $1.81)
   - The issue: 0.50 is being treated as 0.50% instead of 50%
   - Current calculation: $361.55 × 0.50% = $1.81

## Root Causes

1. **Agent Commission Rate Storage**: The system stores agent commission rates as decimals (0.50 for 50%) but the calculation expects percentages
2. **Streamlit Form Limitation**: Forms in Streamlit don't update in real-time - calculations only happen on form submission
3. **No Dynamic Updates**: When user changes Premium Sold or Gross Comm %, the calculated fields don't update until form is submitted

## Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed decimal/percentage conversion**:
   ```python
   # If agent_comm_rate is less than 1, assume it's a decimal and convert to percentage
   if agent_comm_rate > 0 and agent_comm_rate < 1:
       agent_comm_rate = agent_comm_rate * 100
   ```

2. **Working within Streamlit's limitations**: 
   - Calculations now happen when form loads and when submitted
   - Fields are properly disabled to show they're calculated
   - Tooltips show the formula being used

## Testing Instructions

1. Edit Collins Telecom again
2. The form should now show:
   - Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue: $361.55 (correct)
   - Agent Estimated Comm $: $180.78 (corrected from $1.81)

3. Try changing values:
   - Change Premium Sold or Policy Gross Comm %
   - Submit the form
   - Calculated fields should update with new values

## Note on Real-Time Updates

Due to Streamlit's form architecture, real-time updates (as you type) are not possible within forms. The calculations update when:
1. The form first loads
2. The form is submitted

This is a limitation of Streamlit forms, not the implementation.

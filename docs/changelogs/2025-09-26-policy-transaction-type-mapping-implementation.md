# Policy Type and Transaction Type Mapping Implementation - January 26, 2025

## Overview
Implemented the missing UI functionality for Policy Type Mapping and Transaction Types & Mapping in the Admin Panel. These features allow users to map their custom policy and transaction types to standard categories for better organization and reporting.

## Problem
- The Policy Type Mapping tab showed only placeholder text: "Policy type mapping functionality will be implemented here"
- The Transaction Types & Mapping tab also had placeholder content
- Backend functionality existed in `user_mappings_db.py` but was not exposed in the UI
- Users couldn't configure mappings for CSV imports and data standardization

## Solution Implemented

### Policy Type Mapping (Tab 5)
Added complete UI functionality:
- **Current Mappings Display**: Shows all configured mappings in a clean table format
- **Add/Edit Mapping**: Text input for custom types, dropdown for standard categories
- **Remove Mapping**: Select and remove individual mappings
- **Download Mappings**: Export current mappings as JSON file
- **Reset to Defaults**: One-click reset to system default mappings

Standard policy types available:
- HOME, AUTOP, AUTOB, PL, GL, WC, PROP-C, CONDO, FLOOD, BOAT, DFIRE, UMBRELLA, OTHER

### Transaction Types & Mapping (Tab 6)
Added complete UI functionality:
- **Current Transaction Mappings**: Display all configured transaction type mappings
- **Add/Edit Transaction Mapping**: Map custom transaction codes to standard types
- **Remove Transaction Mapping**: Select and remove individual mappings
- **Download Transaction Mappings**: Export current mappings as JSON
- **Reset to Defaults**: One-click reset to default transaction mappings
- **Informational Section**: Explains standard transaction types and PMT special case

Standard transaction types available:
- NEW (New Business)
- RWL (Renewal)
- END (Endorsement)
- CAN (Cancellation)
- PMT (Payment/Commission)
- REI (Reinstatement)
- AUD (Audit)
- OTH (Other)

## Technical Details
- Uses existing `user_mappings_db.py` module for backend operations
- Maintains user isolation - each user has their own mappings
- Data stored in database tables: `user_policy_type_mappings` and `user_transaction_type_mappings`
- Automatic uppercase conversion for consistency
- Real-time updates with `st.rerun()` after changes

## Benefits
- Users can now standardize their custom policy and transaction types
- Improves CSV import accuracy by mapping custom codes to standard categories
- Better reporting and organization of data
- Export/import capability for backup and sharing configurations
- Clear visual representation of all mappings

## Usage
1. Navigate to Admin Panel â†’ Policy Type Mapping or Transaction Types & Mapping tabs
2. View current mappings in the left column
3. Add new mappings using the form in the right column
4. Remove unwanted mappings with the removal tool
5. Download mappings for backup or reset to defaults as needed

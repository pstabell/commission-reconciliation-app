# Reconciliation Column Mappings Persistence Fix

**Date**: January 26, 2025
**Issue**: Custom column mappings on the reconciliation page were not persisting after app refresh
**Status**: FIXED

## Problem Description

Users reported that when they saved custom column mappings on the Reconciliation page's "Import Statement" tab, these mappings would disappear after refreshing the app. This forced users to manually re-map columns every time they imported a CSV/Excel file.

## Root Cause

The column mappings were being saved to `st.session_state`, which is temporary and cleared when:
- The app refreshes
- The user navigates away and comes back
- The browser session ends

The functions `load_saved_column_mappings()` and `save_column_mappings_to_file()` in `commission_app.py` were using session state as storage instead of a persistent database.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created new database-backed module**: `user_reconciliation_mappings_db.py`
   - Handles saving/loading reconciliation column mappings to/from database
   - User-specific mappings (each user has their own saved mappings)
   - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

2. **Database table**: `user_reconciliation_mappings`
   - Stores mappings per user with unique names
   - JSONB column for flexible column mapping storage
   - Proper indexes and RLS policies for security

3. **Updated commission_app.py**:
   - Modified reconciliation page to use database functions
   - Save mappings directly to database
   - Load mappings from database on page load
   - Added proper delete functionality

## Files Changed

1. **New Files**:
   - `/user_reconciliation_mappings_db.py` - Database handler for reconciliation mappings
   - `/sql_scripts/create_user_reconciliation_mappings.sql` - Table creation script

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `/commission_app.py` - Updated to use database-backed mappings

## Database Changes Required

Run the following SQL to create the required table:

```sql
-- Run the script: sql_scripts/create_user_reconciliation_mappings.sql
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Saving a Mapping**:
   - User enters a mapping name
   - Clicks "Save Mapping" 
   - Mapping is saved to database under their user account
   - Persists across sessions

2. **Loading a Mapping**:
   - Saved mappings are loaded from database on page load
   - User selects from dropdown
   - Clicks "Load" to apply the mapping
   - Column mappings auto-populate

3. **Deleting a Mapping**:
   - User clicks trash icon next to a saved mapping
   - Mapping is removed from database
   - No longer appears in dropdown

## Benefits

- Column mappings persist permanently
- Each user has their own saved mappings
- Can save multiple mappings with descriptive names
- No need to re-map columns after refresh
- Improved user experience for frequent reconciliations

## Testing

1. Go to Reconciliation page > Import Statement tab
2. Upload a CSV/Excel file
3. Map some columns
4. Save the mapping with a name
5. Refresh the app (F5)
6. Go back to Reconciliation > Import Statement
7. Upload a file
8. Load your saved mapping - it should persist!

## Notes

- Old mappings saved in JSON files are imported once on first load for backward compatibility
- Each user's mappings are completely isolated from other users
- The session state is still used for caching to improve performance

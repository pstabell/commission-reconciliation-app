# Reconciliation Page Column Mapping Save Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Issue Type**: Feature Fix
**Component**: Reconciliation Page

## Issues Reported

### 1. Column Mappings Not Saving
**Problem**: Users reported that column mappings on the reconciliation page were not persisting between sessions.

**Root Cause**: The reconciliation page had no save button for the column mappings selected in Step 2. The mappings were only stored in session state (`st.session_state.column_mapping`) and would be lost when the session ended. The existing "Save/Load Column Mappings" section at the top only worked with pre-existing mappings.

### 2. Missing "Checking for unmapped transaction types" Section
**Problem**: User reported that the "Checking for unmapped transaction types..." section with Matched/Unmatched/Can Create stats was missing.

**Root Cause**: This section is not missing - it appears AFTER clicking the "üîç Process & Match Transactions" button. The checking happens during processing (lines 10425-10543 in commission_app.py).

## Solution Implemented

### Fix for Column Mapping Save

Added a "üíæ Save Current Column Mapping" button after the column mapping section (line 10370):

```python
# Add save button for the current column mappings
st.divider()
col_save1, col_save2, col_save3 = st.columns([1, 2, 1])
with col_save2:
    if st.button("üíæ Save Current Column Mapping", type="secondary", use_container_width=True):
        if st.session_state.column_mapping:
            # Generate a default name based on the CSV filename or current date
            default_name = f"Mapping_{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"
            if uploaded_file:
                # Use the filename without extension
                import os
                base_name = os.path.splitext(uploaded_file.name)[0]
                default_name = f"{base_name}_mapping"
            
            # Save with a generated name
            if save_reconciliation_column_mapping(default_name, st.session_state.column_mapping):
                st.success(f"‚úÖ Saved column mapping as: {default_name}")
                # Reload saved mappings
                st.session_state.saved_column_mappings = load_saved_column_mappings()
            else:
                st.error("Failed to save column mapping")
        else:
            st.warning("No column mapping to save")
```

### Features of the Fix:
1. **Auto-naming**: Uses the uploaded file name as the base for the mapping name
2. **Fallback naming**: If no file name available, uses timestamp
3. **Immediate feedback**: Shows success/error messages
4. **Session state update**: Reloads saved mappings after successful save

## How the Transaction Type Checking Works

The "Checking for unmapped transaction types" section appears when you click "Process & Match Transactions":

1. First checks for unmapped policy types (lines 10378-10419)
2. Then checks for unmapped transaction types (lines 10425-10468)
3. Shows the matching stats (Matched/Unmatched/Can Create) after successful processing (lines 10535-10543)

## User Instructions

### To Save Column Mappings:
1. Upload your statement file
2. Map the columns to system fields
3. Click "üíæ Save Current Column Mapping" button
4. The mapping will be saved with an auto-generated name

### To See Transaction Type Checking:
1. Complete column mapping
2. Click "üîç Process & Match Transactions"
3. The system will check for unmapped types and show statistics

## Technical Details

- Column mappings are saved to the `user_reconciliation_mappings` table
- Each user has their own mappings (user isolation maintained)
- The save function uses `save_reconciliation_column_mapping()` from `user_reconciliation_mappings_db.py`

## Prevention

To prevent confusion in the future:
- The save button is now prominently displayed after column mapping
- Auto-naming prevents users from having to think of mapping names
- Clear success/error messages provide immediate feedback

# Admin Panel Tab Reorganization - January 23, 2025

## Overview
Reorganized the Admin Panel tabs to improve user experience and discoverability. Moved user-facing configuration tools from Admin Panel to Tools page, reducing Admin Panel from 11 tabs to 6 visible tabs.

## Problem
- Admin Panel had 11 tabs, with some hidden and requiring horizontal scrolling
- Users couldn't find important features like "Default Agent Rates" (tab 11)
- Mix of administrative functions and user tools in one location
- Poor user experience with hidden functionality

## Solution Implemented
Moved 5 user-facing tabs from Admin Panel to Tools page:

### Tabs Moved to Tools Page:
1. **Column Mapping** ‚Üí Tools tab 6
   - User-specific display name configuration
   - Customize how database columns appear in the UI

2. **System Tools** ‚Üí **Preferences** (Tools tab 7)
   - Renamed for clarity
   - Contains display preferences and color themes
   - System information and session management

3. **Default Agent Rates** ‚Üí Tools tab 8
   - Previously hidden as tab 11 in Admin Panel
   - Now easily discoverable in Tools
   - Configure default commission rates for new business and renewals

4. **Deletion History** ‚Üí **Recovery Tools** (Tools tab 9)
   - Renamed for clarity
   - View and restore deleted policy transactions
   - Export deletion history

5. **Data Management** ‚Üí Merged into existing **Data Tools** (Tools tab 1)
   - Database backup functionality
   - Data validation tools
   - Consolidated with other data utilities

### Final Structure

**Admin Panel (6 tabs - all visible):**
1. Database Info
2. Debug Logs
3. Formulas & Calculations
4. Policy Types
5. Policy Type Mapping
6. Transaction Types & Mapping

**Tools Page (9 tabs):**
1. Data Tools (includes former Data Management functions)

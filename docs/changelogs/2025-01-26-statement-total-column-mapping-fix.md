# Statement Total Column Mapping Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-26  
**Issue:** Statement total showing $3,179.13 instead of correct $1,568.94 in verification check  
**Root Cause:** User was mapping "Total Agent Comm" column (earned commissions) instead of "Pay Amount" column (paid commissions) for reconciliation

## Problem Description

When importing commission statements for reconciliation, the verification check was displaying an incorrect statement total of $3,179.13 instead of the expected $1,568.94. Investigation revealed that:

1. The "Total Agent Comm" column contains the total earned commissions ($3,179.13)
2. The "Pay Amount" column contains the actual paid amounts ($1,568.94) 
3. Users were incorrectly mapping "Total Agent Comm" to the "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)" field

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Column Mapping Warnings
- Real-time warning when user selects a "Total Agent Comm" column for Agent Paid Amount
- Explains the difference between earned vs paid commissions
- Suggests looking for "Pay Amount" or similar columns

### 2. Added Validation Before Processing
- Detects if a "Total Agent Comm" column is mapped as Agent Paid Amount
- Lists alternative "Pay Amount" columns if available
- Shows totals for each column to help users identify the correct one

### 3. Added Debug Output
- Shows which columns are being summed for statement total
- Identifies if "Total Agent Comm" columns exist and their totals
- Confirms when the correct total is stored in session state
- Displays debug info in verification check to confirm correct value

## Code Changes

1. **Column Mapping UI** (lines 10964-11025)
   - Added warning when "Total Agent Comm" is selected for Agent Paid Amount
   - Provides immediate feedback to guide correct column selection

2. **Pre-Processing Validation** (lines 11036-11063)  
   - Added validation check before processing transactions
   - Shows column totals to help users verify their selection
   - Lists alternative columns that might be correct

3. **Statement Total Calculation** (lines 11216-11237)
   - Added debug output to identify "Total Agent Comm" confusion
   - Shows when incorrect total is being calculated
   - Confirms correct value is stored

4. **Verification Check Display** (lines 4606-4611)
   - Added debug output showing actual stored value
   - Identifies if incorrect total is being displayed

## User Impact

Users will now:
1. Get immediate warnings if they select the wrong column
2. See helpful suggestions for the correct column to use
3. Can compare column totals before processing
4. Have clear guidance on earned vs paid commission columns

## Prevention

The system now actively prevents this common mistake by:
- Warning during column selection
- Validating before processing
- Showing column totals for verification
- Providing clear explanations of column purposes

This ensures users map the correct "paid amount" column for accurate reconciliation totals.

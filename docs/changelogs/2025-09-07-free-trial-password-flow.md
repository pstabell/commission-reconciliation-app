# Changelog: 14-Day Free Trial and Password Setup Flow

**Date**: January 7, 2025 (Evening Session)  
**Version**: 4.3.0  
**Author**: Claude with Patrick Stabell  

## Summary

Implemented a complete 14-day free trial with credit card requirement and a secure password setup flow for new subscribers.

## Major Features

### 1. 14-Day Free Trial with Credit Card

**Implementation**:
```python
checkout_session = stripe.checkout.Session.create(
    # ... existing parameters ...
    subscription_data={
        'trial_period_days': 14,  # NEW: 14-day free trial
    },
)
```

**UI Changes**:
- Button text: "üöÄ Start Free Trial" (was "Subscribe Now")
- Header: "Start Your 14-Day Free Trial"
- Subtext: "Then $19.99/month"
- Caption: "No charge for 14 days. Cancel anytime."

**Benefits**:
- Higher quality leads (credit card = serious users)
- Automatic conversion after trial
- No manual billing collection needed
- Industry-standard approach

### 2. Complete Password Setup Flow

**The Problem**:
After Stripe checkout, users had no way to set a password and access their account. The webhook created their user record but they couldn't log in.

**The Solution**:
1. **Webhook generates setup token** when creating new user
2. **Password setup email** sent with secure link
3. **Dedicated setup form** for password creation
4. **Auto-login** after password is set
5. **Clear instructions** on success page

**Key Components**:

#### Password Setup Email
- Subject: "Set Your Password - Agent Commission Tracker"
- Professional HTML template with clear CTA button
- Warning that link expires in 1 hour
- Includes trial details and next steps

#### Success Page Updates
```markdown
üéâ Payment successful! Your 14-day free trial has started.
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Check your email (including SPAM folder) for a secure link to set your password.

What to do next:
1. Check your email inbox
2. Look for "Set Your Password - Agent Commission Tracker"
3. If not in inbox, check your SPAM/Junk folder
4. Click the "Set Your Password" button in the email
5. Create your password and you'll be logged in automatically
```

#### Password Setup Form
- Welcome message for new users
- Password minimum 8 characters
- Confirms password match
- Auto-login on success
- Consistent UI with other forms

### 3. Enhanced Login Security

**Before**: Login accepted any password (MVP behavior)
**After**: Login verifies actual user passwords

```python
# Check if user has set a password
if user.get('password_set', False) and user.get('password_hash'):
    # Verify password
    if password == user.get('password_hash'):
        # Allow login
    else:
        st.error("Incorrect password. Please try again.")
else:
    st.error("Please set your password first. Check your email for the setup link.")
```

## Technical Details

### Database Changes
- Added `password_set` boolean flag to users table
- Added `password_hash` field (currently plain text - needs hashing for production)
- Reuses `password_reset_tokens` table for setup tokens

### URL Parameters
- Added `?setup_token=xxx` handling in main()
- Shows password setup form instead of login when token present
- Clears URL after successful password creation

### Files Modified
1. **auth_helpers.py**
   - Added `generate_setup_token()`
   - Added `show_password_setup_form()`
   - Updated login to verify passwords

2. **email_utils.py**
   - Added `send_password_setup_email()`
   - Professional template matching other emails

3. **webhook_server.py**
   - Generates setup token for new users
   - Sends password setup email instead of generic welcome
   - Stores token with 1-hour expiry

4. **commission_app.py**
   - Added setup_token URL parameter handling
   - Enhanced success page with email instructions
   - Added SPAM folder reminders

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Start Free Trial" on landing page
2. Enters credit card on Stripe (no charge for 14 days)
3. Redirected back to app with success message
4. Clear instructions to check email (including SPAM)
5. Receives password setup email
6. Clicks secure link (expires in 1 hour)
7. Sets password (min 8 characters)
8. Automatically logged in and can use app

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (MVP)
- Passwords stored in plain text
- Simple string comparison for verification
- Tokens expire in 1 hour
- Tokens marked as used after completion

### Production Requirements
- Implement bcrypt or similar for password hashing
- Add password strength requirements
- Consider 2FA for high-value accounts
- Add rate limiting on login attempts

## Metrics to Track

- Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Password setup completion rate
- Time from payment to first login
- Email delivery success rate
- SPAM folder percentage

## Next Steps

1. **Add password hashing** - Critical before real production use
2. **Implement "Resend setup email"** - For users who miss the first email
3. **Add password strength meter** - Help users create secure passwords
4. **Create admin dashboard** - Monitor trial conversions
5. **A/B test email subject lines** - Optimize open rates
6. **Add progress indicator** - Show users where they are in setup

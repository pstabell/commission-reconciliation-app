# Edit Policy Duplicate Bug - Complete Fix
**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: RESOLVED ✅
**Severity**: Critical

## Summary
Fixed a critical bug where editing a single transaction in the Edit Policy Transactions page would create duplicates of the entire dataset (425 → 535+ records).

## Problem Details
- Editing one record (e.g., changing "Katie Oster" to "Katie Oyster") created duplicates
- Transaction count jumped from 425 to 535+ records
- Bug ONLY affected PRODUCTION environment, not PRIVATE database
- Root cause: Complex user filtering in PRODUCTION + stale session state

## Solution Implemented - 5 Layers of Protection

### Layer 1: Data Loading Deduplication
```python
if 'Transaction ID' in df.columns:
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Transaction ID'])
```

### Layer 2: Change Detection
- Only process rows that were actually edited
- Compare edited_data with original_data to find changes

### Layer 3: Session State Comparison with Abort
- If comparison fails, refuse to process ANY rows
- Shows error: "Unable to detect changes"

### Layer 4: Transaction ID Verification
- Double-checks database before inserting any "new" record
- Skips if transaction already exists

### Layer 5: Update-Only Fallback
- If change detection fails, only allows UPDATES, never INSERTS

## Key Insights
1. **PRODUCTION vs PRIVATE**: PRODUCTION uses complex filtering (user_id → email → case-insensitive), PRIVATE loads all data simply
2. **Session State**: Stale session state in regular browsing caused comparison failures
3. **Auto-save Conflict**: Disabled auto-save by default to prevent conflicts

## Testing Results
- ✅ No duplicates created when editing single records
- ✅ Transaction count remains stable at 425
- ✅ All user edits preserved correctly

## Lessons Learned
1. Multi-environment testing is crucial (PRODUCTION vs PRIVATE)
2. Session state persistence can cause subtle bugs
3. Multiple defensive layers prevent catastrophic failures
4. Complex filtering logic needs extra validation

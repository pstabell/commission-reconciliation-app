# Changelog: Webhook DateTime Import Fix

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Version**: 4.3.1  
**Author**: Claude with Patrick Stabell  

## Summary

Fixed critical webhook server error that was preventing all webhook functionality including user creation and email sending after Stripe checkout.

## The Issue

### Error Message
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'datetime' where it is not associated with a value
```

### Root Cause
The webhook server had conflicting datetime imports:
1. Module-level import: `from datetime import datetime` (line 6)
2. Function-level import: `from datetime import datetime, timedelta` (line 169)

When Python encountered the second import inside the function, it created a local variable `datetime` that shadowed the module-level import. This caused line 54 (`print(f"Webhook received at {datetime.now()}")`) to fail because it referenced the local variable before it was assigned.

### Impact
- All webhook calls returned error 500
- No user records created after successful Stripe checkout
- No password setup emails sent to new subscribers
- Users could pay but couldn't access the application

## The Fix

### Code Changes
```python
# Before (line 6):
from datetime import datetime

# After (line 6):
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Removed (line 169):
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  # This line deleted
```

### Files Modified
- `webhook_server.py` - Fixed datetime imports

## Technical Details

### Why This Happened
Python's scoping rules treat any variable assigned within a function as local to that function. The import statement `from datetime import datetime, timedelta` inside the function created a local `datetime` variable, making all references to `datetime` within the function (including those before the import) reference the local variable.

### Prevention
- Always import all needed components at the module level
- Avoid importing inside functions unless absolutely necessary
- If function-level imports are needed, use different names to avoid shadowing

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. Webhook health check endpoint works: `/health`
2. Stripe webhook signature verification passes
3. User records created after checkout
4. Password setup emails sent successfully
5. No Python errors in webhook logs

### Test Command
```bash
curl https://commission-tracker-webhook.onrender.com/health
```

## Deployment

The fix was committed and pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git add webhook_server.py
git commit -m "fix: Resolve webhook debug_info undefined variable error"
git push
```

Render automatically detected the push and redeployed the webhook service.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Single Repository Architecture**: This project uses one repository for both the main app and webhook server, which can cause confusion
2. **Shared Dependencies**: Both services share utility files, making the single-repo approach necessary
3. **Import Best Practices**: Always prefer module-level imports to avoid scoping issues
4. **Error Monitoring**: Webhook errors can be silent - need better monitoring

## Documentation Updates

Created comprehensive project structure documentation (`/docs/core/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`) to clarify:
- Single repository contains both main app and webhook server
- Two separate Render services deploy from same repository
- Webhook server is not a separate project
- How to debug and fix webhook issues

## Next Steps

1. **Add webhook monitoring** - Set up alerts for webhook failures
2. **Add retry logic** - Handle temporary failures gracefully  
3. **Improve error logging** - More detailed error messages
4. **Add webhook tests** - Automated testing for webhook functionality

**Version**: 4.2.0 - 4.3.0  
**Author**: Claude with Patrick Stabell  

## Summary

This release focused on implementing an AI chatbot for the Carrd landing page, rebranding the application, improving the login/register/subscribe UI, and adding a complete 14-day free trial with password setup flow.

## Major Changes

### 1. Carrd Pro AI Chatbot Integration

**Solution**: 
- Implemented Crisp free plan chatbot on agentcommissiontracker.com

- All responses limited to under 1000 characters for better readability

**Technical Details**:
- Platform: Crisp (free plan)
- Landing Page: Updated from commissiontracker.carrd.co to agentcommissiontracker.com
- Special Feature: All subscribe links include ?subscribe=true parameter for auto-tab switching

### 2. Complete App Rebranding

**Problem**: Need to update branding from "Commission Tracker Pro" to "Agent Commission Tracker".

**Solution**:
- Updated all references throughout codebase

### 3. Login/Register/Subscribe UI Improvements

**Solution**:
- Added 2px gray borders to all input fields

- Standardized all forms to use column ratio [2, 3]
- Made form fields same width as buttons
- Wrapped all forms in st.form() for better UX

**CSS Implementation**:
```css
.stTextInput > div > div > input {
    border: 2px solid #cccccc !important;
    border-radius: 4px !important;
    padding: 8px 12px !important;
}
```

### 4. Subscribe Tab URL Parameter

**Problem**: Chatbot needed to send users directly to subscribe tab.

**Solution**:
- Added URL parameter detection for ?subscribe=true
- Auto-switches to subscribe tab when parameter is present
- All chatbot links updated to include this parameter

## Known Issues

### 1. Excessive White Space on Login Pages
- **Issue**: Large amounts of white space at top and bottom of login/register/subscribe pages
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Reduced padding from 1rem to 0.5rem to 0.25rem
  - Added wildcard CSS to target all Streamlit containers
  - Used display: none on header
  - Applied negative margins
  - Nuclear CSS option with padding: 0 on everything
- **Status**: Issue persists - added to backlog for future investigation
- **Theory**: Streamlit may be injecting spacing via JavaScript after CSS loads

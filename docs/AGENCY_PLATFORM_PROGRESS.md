## 🎯 How to Demo

### For Prospective Customers

1. **Open the app**
2. **Enable demo mode** (checkbox in sidebar)
3. **Click "🏢 Agency Dashboard"**
   - Show agent rankings
   - Point out performance metrics
   - Highlight the charts
4. **Click "🔗 Integrations"**
   - Show the 20+ integrations catalog
   - Point out their specific system (Applied Epic, QuickBooks, etc.)

5. **Customize for prospect**:

### The Pitch

> "This is exactly what your agency dashboard will look like. You'll see all your agents ranked by performance in real-time. We'll integrate with [Applied Epic/their system] to automatically sync policies and commissions. Your agents log in and see only their own data, while you see the full agency view."

## 🔒 Branch Safety

**All work is on `agency-platform` branch:**
- ✅ Main branch completely untouched
- ✅ Production app unaffected
- ✅ Can delete branch anytime if we abandon this direction
- ✅ Can merge to main after 2-3 successful customers

**To abandon this if it doesn't work:**
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D agency-platform
```
Everything goes away, production app stays safe.

**To continue development:**
```bash
git checkout agency-platform
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"
git push origin agency-platform
```

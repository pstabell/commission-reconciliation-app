# Phase 2 Implementation Progress - Frontend Polish
**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Objectives

Enhance the frontend display of formula calculations throughout the application, making it clear which values are calculated vs. manual entries.

## âœ… Completed So Far

### 1. Formula Calculations in Main Data Grid
- Added `calculate_formula_values()` function
- Displays 4 new columns in "All Policies" view:
  - **Agency Comm (Formula)**: Auto-calculated from Premium Ã— Gross Comm %
  - **Agent Comm (Formula)**: Auto-calculated based on transaction type
  - **Agency Comm Variance**: Shows difference between manual and formula
  - **Agent Comm Variance**: Shows difference between manual and formula

### 2. Smart Column Ordering
- Formula columns appear immediately after their corresponding manual columns
- Makes it easy to compare manual vs. calculated values side-by-side

### 3. Export Enhancements
- CSV exports now include formula columns
- Excel exports include all calculated values
- Both page-specific and full exports have formulas

### 4. Visual Indicators
- Info banner explains formula columns
- Column tooltips indicate auto-calculated values
- Clear labeling with "(Formula)" suffix

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New Function: `calculate_formula_values(df)`
```python
# Calculates four new columns:
- Agency Comm (Formula) = Premium Sold Ã— Policy Gross Comm % / 100
- Agent Comm (Formula) = Agency Comm Ã— Agent Rate / 100
- Agency Comm Variance = Manual Entry - Formula Value
- Agent Comm Variance = Manual Entry - Formula Value
```

### Agent Rate Logic:
- NEW, NBS, STL, BoR: 50%
- RWL, REWRITE: 25%
- CAN, XCL: 0%
- END, PCH: 50% if new, 25% if renewal

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Changes

1. **Navigate to "All Policies in Database"**
2. **Look for the new columns**:
   - After "Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)" â†’ "Agency Comm (Formula)" + Variance
   - After "Agent Estimated Comm $" â†’ "Agent Comm (Formula)" + Variance
3. **Check variance columns**: Non-zero values indicate manual overrides
4. **Export data**: Verify formulas are included in exports

## ðŸ“‹ Still To Do in Phase 2

- [ ] Add visual styling (background colors) for formula columns
- [ ] Add formula indicators (calculator icons)
- [ ] Implement conditional formatting for large variances
- [ ] Add formula display in Policy Revenue Ledger
- [ ] Create formula legend/help section

## ðŸŽ¨ Next Visual Enhancements

1. **Color Coding**:
   - Light blue background for formula columns
   - Light red for variance columns with significant differences
   - Green checkmarks for matching values

2. **Icons**:
   - Calculator icon for formula columns
   - Warning icon for large variances
   - Info icon with formula details on hover

3. **Summary Statistics**:
   - Total variance amounts
   - Count of manual overrides
   - Percentage accuracy metrics

*Phase 2 is bringing transparency to commission calculations by showing formulas alongside manual entries throughout the application.*

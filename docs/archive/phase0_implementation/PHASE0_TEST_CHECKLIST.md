# Phase 0 Testing Checklist

**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Updated**: July 6, 2025 - Critical bug discovered
**Purpose**: Verify reconciliation transaction protection is working correctly

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED - July 6, 2025

### Issue: Reconciliation Protection Not Working
**Test 2.2 Failed**: Reconciliation transactions (-STMT-) are visible and editable in Edit Policies page

**Root Cause**: Column name detection logic fails
- Code searches for columns containing both "transaction" AND "id" (lowercase)
- Actual column name is "Transaction ID" (with space) or similar variation
- Detection returns `None`, bypassing all protection logic

**Impact**:
- ❌ Reconciliation transactions are NOT protected
- ❌ -STMT- transactions can be edited/deleted
- ❌ No warning messages shown to users
- ❌ Phase 0 security objectives NOT met

**Evidence**:
- Thomas Barboun search returns "Found 2 records for editing"
- Should show: "Found 1 editable transaction" + "🔒 1 reconciliation entry"
- Both regular (7C8LPL9) and reconciliation (RD84L6D-STMT-20240630) transactions visible

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### 1. Application Startup
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Can log in successfully
- [ ] All menu items are accessible

### 2. Edit Policies - Search & Display

#### Test 2.1: Search for Regular Transactions
- [ ] Go to "Edit Policies in Database"
- [ ] Search for a customer with ONLY regular transactions
- [ ] ✓ Verify message shows: "Found X transactions for editing"
- [ ] ✓ Verify all transactions appear in the data editor
- [ ] ✓ Verify you can select transactions with checkboxes

#### Test 2.2: Search for Mixed Transactions
- [ ] Search for a customer that has BOTH regular AND reconciliation transactions
- [ ] Search for terms like "STMT" or a customer you know has reconciliations
- [ ] ✓ Verify you see TWO messages:
  - "Found X editable transactions" (green)
  - "🔒 Y reconciliation entries (view in Reconciliation page)" (blue info)
- [ ] ✓ Verify ONLY regular transactions appear in the data editor
- [ ] ✓ Verify -STMT-, -VOID-, -ADJ- transactions are NOT visible

#### Test 2.3: Search for Only Reconciliation Transactions
- [ ] Search for "-STMT-" directly to find only reconciliation transactions
- [ ] ✓ Verify warning: "No editable transactions found. All transactions for this customer are reconciliation entries."
- [ ] ✓ Verify NO data editor is shown

### 3. Edit Policies - Editing Functions

#### Test 3.1: Edit Regular Transaction
- [ ] Search for a customer with regular transactions
- [ ] Select ONE transaction using the checkbox
- [ ] Click "✏️ Edit Selected Transaction"
- [ ] ✓ Verify the edit form opens normally
- [ ] ✓ Make a small change (like updating notes)
- [ ] ✓ Save and verify the change persists

#### Test 3.2: Attempt to Edit Reconciliation (if any show up)
- [ ] If somehow a reconciliation transaction appears and can be selected
- [ ] Try to click "✏️ Edit Selected Transaction"
- [ ] ✓ Verify error message: "🔒 This is a reconciliation transaction and cannot be edited."
- [ ] ✓ Verify you see guidance to use Reconciliation page
- [ ] ✓ Verify Close button works to exit

### 4. Edit Policies - Deletion Protection

#### Test 4.1: Delete Regular Transactions
- [ ] Search for a customer with regular transactions
- [ ] Select 1-2 regular transactions with checkboxes
- [ ] ✓ Verify delete section shows at bottom
- [ ] ✓ Verify warning shows selected transaction count
- [ ] ✓ Click "🗑️ Confirm Delete"
- [ ] ✓ Verify transactions are deleted successfully

#### Test 4.2: Attempt to Delete Reconciliation (if any show up)
- [ ] If reconciliation transactions somehow appear in editor
- [ ] Try to select them with checkboxes
- [ ] ✓ Verify error: "🔒 Cannot delete X reconciliation transaction(s):"
- [ ] ✓ Verify the transaction IDs are listed
- [ ] ✓ Verify info message about using Reconciliation page
- [ ] ✓ Verify these transactions are NOT deleted

### 5. Data Integrity Verification

#### Test 5.1: Check Reconciliation Page
- [ ] Go to "Reconciliation" page
- [ ] ✓ Verify all -STMT-, -VOID-, -ADJ- transactions ARE visible here
- [ ] ✓ Verify reconciliation functions work normally

#### Test 5.2: Check Transaction Counts
- [ ] Note a customer's total transaction count in "All Policies"
- [ ] Search for same customer in "Edit Policies"
- [ ] ✓ Verify: Editable count + Reconciliation count = Total count

### 6. Edge Cases

#### Test 6.1: Special Characters in Search
- [ ] Try searching with special characters: "-", "_", "STMT"
- [ ] ✓ Verify search works correctly
- [ ] ✓ Verify filtering behaves properly

#### Test 6.2: Auto-save with Protected Transactions
- [ ] Ensure auto-save is enabled
- [ ] Edit a regular transaction
- [ ] ✓ Verify auto-save works for regular transactions
- [ ] ✓ Verify no errors occur related to reconciliation transactions

## 📊 Expected Results Summary

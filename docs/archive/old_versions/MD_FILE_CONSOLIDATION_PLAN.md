# .MD File Consolidation Plan
**Date**: July 6, 2025  
**Current State**: 60+ .md files with significant overlap  
**Goal**: Reduce to ~15 core files with clear organization

## 🎯 Major Consolidation Actions

### 1. Formula Documentation (6 files → 1 file)
**Merge into**: `FORMULA_SYSTEM.md`
- FORMULA_DESIGN.md (keep as base)
- FORMULA_IMPLEMENTATION_PHASE0.md
- FORMULA_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- FORMULA_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
- FORMULA_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md
- All PHASE0_*.md files

**New Structure**:
```
FORMULA_SYSTEM.md
├── Design Overview
├── Implementation Phases
│   ├── Phase 0: Security Fix (completed)
│   ├── Phase 1: Edit Form (completed)
│   ├── Phase 2: Data Grid (completed)
│   └── Phase 3-4: Future Plans
├── Technical Details
├── Known Issues & Fixes
└── Testing Checklists
```

### 2. Reconciliation Documentation (4 files → 1 file)
**Merge into**: `RECONCILIATION_SYSTEM.md`
- RECONCILIATION_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md (keep as base)
- RECONCILIATION_MATCHING_FIXES.md
- RECONCILIATION_TRANSACTIONS_FOUND.md
- STATEMENT_IMPORT_DESIGN.md (reconciliation parts)

### 3. Security Documentation (3 files → 1 file)
**Merge into**: `SECURITY_SYSTEM.md`
- SECURITY_DESIGN.md (keep as base)
- DATABASE_PROTECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Password protection features

### 4. Project History (5 files → 2 files)
**Keep**:
- `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` - Chronological development record
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Current status and future plans

**Archive**:
- CHANGELOG.md
- CURRENT_STATE.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_*.md
- JULY_6_2025_UPDATES_SUMMARY.md

### 5. Issues & Troubleshooting (5 files → 1 file)
**Merge into**: `KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md`
- APP_ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md
- transaction_id_fixes.md
- TERMINAL_PROBLEMS.md
- PHASE0_CRITICAL_BUG.md
- Technical issues from other files

**Keep separate**: `TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` (user-facing)

### 6. Architecture & Design (4 files → 2 files)
**Core Files**:
- `APP_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture
- `UI_DESIGN_STANDARDS.md` - Merge APP_WIDE_DESIGN.md + DASHBOARD_PAGE_DESIGN.md

**Archive**: README_MODULAR.md

### 7. Setup & Migration (3 files → 1 file)
**Merge into**: `SETUP_AND_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
- SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- GIT_GUIDE.md
- Setup instructions from various files

## 🔄 Migration Process

1. **Create new directory structure**
2. **Merge files according to plan**
3. **Update all internal references**
4. **Archive original files**
5. **Update root directory to have single README pointing to /docs**

## 📊 Benefits

- **60+ files → ~15 core files** (75% reduction)
- **Clear organization** by purpose
- **No more overlap** between files
- **Easier to maintain** and update
- **Historical preservation** in archive

## ⚠️ Special Considerations

- **Keep help_content/ separate** - User-facing documentation
- **Preserve all information** - Nothing deleted, only reorganized
- **Maintain git history** - Use git mv for tracking
- **Update references** - Fix all cross-document links

## 🎯 Priority Order

1. Formula consolidation (highest overlap)
2. Reconciliation consolidation
3. Issues consolidation
4. Project history cleanup
5. Architecture merge
6. Create new directory structure

# Reconciliation Transactions Analysis

## Issue Found and Fixed

The search functionality in the application was not finding reconciliation transactions (those containing -STMT-, -VOID-, or -ADJ-) because of a column naming mismatch.

### The Problem
- The search code was looking for columns with underscores: `Transaction_ID`, `Policy_Number`, `Client_ID`
- The actual database columns have spaces: `Transaction ID`, `Policy Number`, `Client ID`

### The Fix
Updated line 1665 and 2100 in commission_app.py:
```python
# OLD (incorrect):
search_columns = ['Customer', 'Policy_Number', 'Transaction_ID', 'Client_ID']

# NEW (correct):
search_columns = ['Customer', 'Policy Number', 'Transaction ID', 'Client ID']
```

## Reconciliation Transactions Found

### Current Data Summary
- Total records in database: 178
- **-STMT- transactions: 2**
- **-VOID- transactions: 0**
- **-ADJ- transactions: 0**

### Specific -STMT- Transactions

1. **Transaction ID:** RD84L6D-STMT-20240630
   - **Customer:** Thomas Barboun
   - **Type:** Statement reconciliation entry

2. **Transaction ID:** F266CCX-STMT-20240630
   - **Customer:** RCM Construction of SWFL LLC
   - **Type:** Statement reconciliation entry

## Testing the Fix

You can now search for these transactions in the application using any of these search terms:
- `-STMT-` (will find all statement reconciliation entries)
- `RD84L6D` (will find Thomas Barboun's reconciliation)
- `F266CCX-STMT-20240630` (exact transaction ID)
- Customer names like "Thomas Barboun"

## Reconciliation Transaction Protection

The application has built-in protection for these reconciliation transactions:

1. **Function `is_reconciliation_transaction()`** (line 144 in commission_app.py):
   - Identifies transactions containing -STMT-, -VOID-, or -ADJ-
   - These transactions are locked from editing to maintain data integrity

2. **Edit Protection:**
   - When viewing/editing data, reconciliation transactions are filtered out
   - Users cannot modify these system-generated entries

## Database Schema

The reconciliation system uses these additional columns:
- `reconciliation_status`: Current status of reconciliation
- `reconciliation_id`: ID linking related reconciliation entries
- `reconciled_at`: Timestamp of reconciliation
- `is_reconciliation_entry`: Boolean flag for reconciliation entries

## Next Steps

With only 2 -STMT- transactions currently in the system, you may want to:
1. Test the reconciliation import feature to create more test transactions
2. Verify the edit protection is working correctly for these transactions
3. Test searching and filtering capabilities with the fixed search function

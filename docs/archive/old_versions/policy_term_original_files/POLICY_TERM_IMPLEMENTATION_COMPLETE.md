# Policy Term Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Database âœ…
- Added "Policy Term" column as INTEGER type to store months (3, 6, 9, 12)
- Added CHECK constraint to ensure valid values
- Added index for performance

### 2. Column Mapping âœ…
- Updated `column_mapping_config.py` to map:
  - UI: "Policy Term Months" â†’ DB: "Policy Term"

### 3. Add New Policy Transaction Form âœ…
- Changed Transaction Type from full-width to left column
- Added Policy Term Months dropdown in right column
- Options: blank, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months
- Added policy_term to the data saved to database

### 4. Edit Policy Transactions Modal âœ…
- Added "Policy Term Months" to policy_fields list (after Transaction Type)
- Added special dropdown handling for Policy Term Months
- Properly handles existing values and null/empty values

### 5. Renewal Calculation Logic âœ…
- Updated `duplicate_for_renewal` function to use Policy Term
- If Policy Term is set, uses that value for calculating new expiration
- If not set or null, defaults to 6 months (preserving current behavior)
- Formula: New Expiration = Previous Expiration + Policy Term months

## Testing Checklist

Please test the following:

1. **Add New Policy**:
   - [ ] Policy Term Months appears next to Transaction Type
   - [ ] Can select 3, 6, 9, or 12 months
   - [ ] Can leave blank (defaults to null)
   - [ ] Saves to database correctly

2. **Edit Policy**:
   - [ ] Policy Term Months appears in Policy Information section
   - [ ] Shows existing values correctly
   - [ ] Can change values
   - [ ] Can clear values (set to blank)

3. **Pending Policy Renewals**:
   - [ ] 6-month policies show renewal 6 months after expiration
   - [ ] 12-month policies show renewal 12 months after expiration
   - [ ] Policies without term default to 6 months

4. **Data Display**:
   - [ ] Policy Term shows in All Policy Transactions
   - [ ] Policy Term shows in Search results
   - [ ] Exports include Policy Term column

## Optional: Populate Existing Data

To set Policy Term for existing policies based on their date ranges, you can run this SQL:

```sql
UPDATE policies 
SET "Policy Term" = 
  CASE 
    WHEN DATE_PART('day', TO_DATE("X-DATE", 'MM/DD/YYYY') - TO_DATE("Effective Date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) BETWEEN 80 AND 100 THEN 3
    WHEN DATE_PART('day', TO_DATE("X-DATE", 'MM/DD/YYYY') - TO_DATE("Effective Date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) BETWEEN 170 AND 190 THEN 6
    WHEN DATE_PART('day', TO_DATE("X-DATE", 'MM/DD/YYYY') - TO_DATE("Effective Date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) BETWEEN 260 AND 280 THEN 9
    WHEN DATE_PART('day', TO_DATE("X-DATE", 'MM/DD/YYYY') - TO_DATE("Effective Date", 'MM/DD/YYYY')) BETWEEN 355 AND 375 THEN 12
    ELSE NULL
  END
WHERE "Policy Term" IS NULL 
  AND "Transaction Type" IN ('NEW', 'RWL');
```

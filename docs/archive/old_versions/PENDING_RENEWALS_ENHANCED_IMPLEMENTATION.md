# Pending Policy Renewals - Enhanced Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement the Edit Transaction form on Pending Policy Renewals page with special handling for renewal workflows and proper date formatting.

## User Experience Design Philosophy
From the user's perspective, they are "editing" the renewal details before committing:
- User sees a policy that needs renewal
- User clicks "Edit" to adjust the renewal details
- User reviews/modifies premium, dates, commissions, etc.
- User clicks "Renew Policy" to finalize

While technically the system creates a NEW transaction, the user experience is designed around "editing the pending renewal" - making adjustments before confirming. This aligns with natural user intuition while maintaining clean data architecture.

## Priority 1: Fix Date Format on Pending Renewals Page
**CRITICAL**: Change all date displays from "2025-07-23 00:00:00" to "MM/DD/YYYY"

### Affected Columns:
- Policy Origination Date
- Effective Date  
- X-DATE (Expiration Date)

### Implementation:
```python
# In the Pending Policy Renewals display section
# Format dates before displaying in table
df['Policy Origination Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Policy Origination Date']).dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
df['Effective Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Effective Date']).dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
df['X-DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['X-DATE']).dt.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
```

## Priority 2: Universal Column Title Change
**Change everywhere in app**: "New Biz Checklist Complete" → "Policy Checklist Complete"

### Locations to Update:
1. Database column name (if possible)
2. Column mapping configuration
3. All form displays
4. All table headers
5. Edit Transaction form
6. Add New Policy Transaction form
7. Any report headers

## Priority 3: Special Field Handling for Renewals

### 3.1 Effective Date
- **Current**: User manually enters
- **Renewal Mode**: Auto-populate with current policy's X-DATE (expiration date)
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  if source_page == "pending_renewals":
      # New effective date = Current policy's expiration date
      new_effective_date = current_policy['X-DATE']
  ```

### 3.2 X-DATE (Expiration Date)
- **Current**: User manually enters
- **Renewal Mode**: Auto-calculate based on Policy Term
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  if source_page == "pending_renewals":
      policy_term_months = current_policy.get('Policy Term', 6)  # Default 6 months
      new_x_date = new_effective_date + timedelta(days=policy_term_months * 30)
  ```

### 3.3 Transaction Type
- **Current**: Dropdown selection
- **Renewal Mode**: Auto-set to "RWL" and make read-only
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  if source_page == "pending_renewals":
      transaction_type = "RWL"  # Force to renewal
      # Display as disabled/read-only field
  ```

### 3.4 Policy Origination Date
- **Current**: Can be edited
- **Renewal Mode**: Keep original date, make read-only
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  if source_page == "pending_renewals":
      # Preserve original policy origination date
      policy_origination_date = current_policy['Policy Origination Date']
      # Display as disabled/read-only field
  ```

### 3.5 Policy Checklist Complete
- **Current**: "New Biz Checklist Complete"
- **Change to**: "Policy Checklist Complete" (universal change)
- **Renewal Mode**: Default to unchecked for renewal processing

## Priority 4: Workflow Considerations Implementation

### 4.1 Form Context Intelligence
Add "Renewal Mode" parameter to edit_transaction_form:
```python
def edit_transaction_form(policy_data, source_page="edit_policies", is_renewal=False):
    if is_renewal:
        # Apply renewal-specific logic
```

### 4.2 Field Pre-population Strategy
**Copy Forward** (keep same value):
- Customer
- Policy Number  
- Carrier Name
- MGA Name
- Agency New or Renewal
- Policy Type
- Policy Term

**Auto-Update** (calculate new value):
- Effective Date → Previous X-DATE
- X-DATE → Effective Date + Policy Term
- Transaction Type → "RWL"
- Transaction_ID → Generate new
- Client_ID → Keep same

**Clear/Reset** (start fresh):
- Premium Sold
- Commissionable Premium
- Commission %
- Commission $
- Producer Commission %
- Producer Commission $
- Override %
- Override Commission
- Commission Already Earned
- Commission Already Received  
- Balance Owed
- Renewal/Bonus Percentage
- Renewal Amount
- Not Paid/Paid
- Policy Checklist Complete → Unchecked

**Preserve** (read-only):
- Policy Origination Date
- ROW ID (new one generated)

### 4.3 Implementation Code Structure
```python
# In Pending Policy Renewals page
if st.button("Edit for Renewal", key=f"renew_{policy_id}"):
    # Prepare renewal data
    renewal_data = prepare_renewal_data(current_policy)
    st.session_state.editing_renewal = True
    st.session_state.renewal_to_edit = renewal_data
    st.session_state.is_renewal_mode = True

def prepare_renewal_data(policy):
    """Transform current policy data for renewal"""
    renewal = policy.copy()
    
    # Auto-updates
    renewal['Effective Date'] = policy['X-DATE']
    renewal['X-DATE'] = calculate_new_expiration(policy['X-DATE'], policy.get('Policy Term', 6))
    renewal['Transaction Type'] = 'RWL'
    renewal['Transaction_ID'] = generate_transaction_id()
    
    # Clear fields
    fields_to_clear = [
        'Premium Sold', 'Commissionable Premium', 'Commission %', 
        'Commission $', 'Producer Commission %', 'Producer Commission $',
        'Override %', 'Override Commission', 'Commission Already Earned',
        'Commission Already Received', 'Balance Owed', 'Renewal/Bonus Percentage',
        'Renewal Amount', 'Not Paid/Paid'
    ]
    for field in fields_to_clear:
        renewal[field] = None or 0 or ''
    
    renewal['Policy Checklist Complete'] = False
    
    return renewal
```

### 4.4 Visual Indicators
When in Renewal Mode:
- Form title: "Edit Renewal Transaction" (aligns with user mental model)
- Highlight auto-populated fields in light blue
- Show read-only fields with lock icon
- Add info box: "Reviewing renewal for Policy: [Policy Number]"
- Save button text: "Renew Policy" (not "Save Changes")

### 4.5 Save Behavior
When clicking "Renew Policy" button:
- Creates NEW transaction (INSERT, not UPDATE)
- Links to original policy via Policy Number
- Transaction Type set to "RWL"
- Returns to Pending Renewals page
- Shows success message: "Policy renewed successfully"
- Original policy remains unchanged in database

## Testing Checklist

### Date Format Tests
- [ ] All dates show as MM/DD/YYYY on Pending Renewals page
- [ ] No timestamps visible (00:00:00 removed)
- [ ] Dates remain sortable in table

### Renewal Mode Tests  
- [ ] Effective Date auto-fills with previous X-DATE
- [ ] X-DATE calculates correctly based on Policy Term
- [ ] Transaction Type locked to "RWL"
- [ ] Policy Origination Date preserved and read-only
- [ ] All payment fields start empty/zero
- [ ] Customer and Policy info carries forward
- [ ] New Transaction_ID generated

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **FIRST**: Fix date format on Pending Renewals (user can't read current format)
2. **SECOND**: Change column title to "Policy Checklist Complete" universally  
3. **THIRD**: Add Edit button to Pending Renewals table
4. **FOURTH**: Implement Renewal Mode logic in form
5. **FIFTH**: Test complete workflow

## Success Metrics

- Dates readable in MM/DD/YYYY format
- Renewal creation takes <30 seconds
- No manual calculation of dates needed
- Clear distinction between edit and renewal modes
- Zero data entry errors from wrong field values
- Consistent user experience across pages

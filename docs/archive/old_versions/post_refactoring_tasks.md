# Post-Refactoring Task List

This file outlines the remaining tasks to complete after the initial refactoring of the application structure.

##  Bug Fixes

- [x] **Fix `OperationalError` in Accounting Page:**
  - **Issue:** The log file shows a recurring error: `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) table policies has no column named Agency Comm Received (STMT)`.
  - **Cause:** The code is trying to save data to a column that likely has a different name in the database (e.g., `Agency Gross Comm Received`).
  - **Solution:** ✅ COMPLETED - Renamed database columns to match UI field names:
    - `ALTER TABLE policies RENAME COLUMN "Agency Gross Comm Received" TO "Agency Comm Received (STMT)"`
    - `ALTER TABLE policies RENAME COLUMN "Paid Amount" TO "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)"`
    - Removed unused "Balance Due" column
    - Updated all code references to use consistent naming

- [x] **Fix `StreamlitAPIException` for Date Formats:**
  - **Issue:** The log file shows an error: `streamlit.errors.StreamlitAPIException: The provided format ('%m/%d/%Y') is not valid.`
  - **Cause:** The `st.date_input` widget requires the format string to be `MM/DD/YYYY`.
  - **Solution:** ✅ COMPLETED - All date inputs now use format="MM/DD/YYYY"

- [x] **Fix `shutil` Not Defined Error:**
  - **Issue:** The log file shows `Emergency freeze failed: cannot access free variable 'shutil'`.
  - **Cause:** The `shutil` module was likely used inside a function without being imported at the top level of the script.
  - **Solution:** ✅ COMPLETED - `import shutil` is present at line 23 of commission_app.py

## Refactoring Completion

- [ ] **Populate Remaining `render_` Functions:**
  - **Task:** Move the code blocks for the remaining pages (`Accounting`, `Policy Revenue Ledger`, etc.) from the main `if/elif` block into their respective `render_...()` functions.

- [ ] **Finalize `main()` Function:**
  - **Task:** Once all pages have their own rendering functions, replace the large `if/elif` block in `main()` with a clean structure that calls the appropriate function based on the page selection.

- [ ] **Remove Duplicated Code:**
  - **Task:** Delete the large, duplicated block of code that was present at the very end of the original `commission_app.py` file to prevent syntax errors and confusion.

## Recently Completed Tasks (July 4, 2025)

### Database Column Standardization
- [x] **Renamed Database Columns for Consistency:**
  - `"Agency Gross Comm Received"` → `"Agency Comm Received (STMT)"`
  - `"Paid Amount"` → `"Agent Paid Amount (STMT)"`
  - Removed unused `"Balance Due"` column
  - Updated column_mapping_config.py to reflect changes

### Reconciliation Fixes
- [x] **Fixed Commission Reconciliation Process:**
  - Resolved "column not found" errors that were flashing too quickly to read
  - Fixed JSON field naming inconsistencies ("Commission Paid" vs "Amount Paid")
  - Changed "Description" references to use "NOTES" field
  - Reconciliation now successfully saves to both commission_payments_simple and policies tables

### Debug Logging System
- [x] **Implemented Comprehensive Debug Logging:**
  - Added `log_debug()` function to capture all system events
  - Created new "Debug Logs" tab in Admin Panel
  - Logs capture timestamp, level (ERROR/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG), message, and error details
  - Added filtering by log level and search functionality
  - Export logs as JSON for troubleshooting
  - Successfully captured fleeting error messages

### Code Improvements
- [x] **Standardized Field Names Across Application:**
  - Changed all instances of "Amount Paid" to "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)"
  - Ensured consistency between UI labels, database columns, and JSON structures
  - Updated manual commission entry forms and display tables

### Migration to PostgreSQL/Supabase
- [x] **Successfully Migrated from SQLite to Supabase:**
  - All data now stored in PostgreSQL database
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) where appropriate
  - Created commission_payments_simple table without RLS for easier access
  - Updated all database queries to use Supabase client

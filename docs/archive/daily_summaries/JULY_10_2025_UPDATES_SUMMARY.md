# July 10, 2025 - Documentation Reorganization

## Summary
Major documentation cleanup and reorganization to improve project structure and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Policy Term Documentation Consolidation
- **Created**: `docs/features/POLICY_TERM_FEATURE.md` - Comprehensive single document combining all Policy Term information
- **Archived**: 9 separate Policy Term documentation files to `docs/archive/old_versions/policy_term_original_files/`
- **Result**: All Policy Term information now in one well-organized location

### 2. Root-Level Documentation Cleanup
- **Moved to Archive**:
  - `DATE_FORMAT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/archive/old_versions/`
  - `MGA_NAME_COLUMN_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `docs/archive/old_versions/`
  - All `POLICY_TERM_*.md` files → `docs/archive/old_versions/policy_term_original_files/`
- **Kept in Root**: 
  - `PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md` (active guide for GitHub operations)

### 3. Documentation Structure
The consolidated Policy Term documentation now includes:
- Complete implementation overview
- User guide with clear instructions
- Migration guide for existing data
- Technical implementation details
- Testing checklist
- FAQ section
- Future enhancement ideas

## Benefits
1. **Easier Navigation**: Single source of truth for Policy Term feature
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory now cleaner and more focused
3. **Better Organization**: All historical docs preserved in archive
4. **Improved Discoverability**: Features documentation in logical location

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for other documentation that could be consolidated
- Consider creating similar comprehensive docs for other major features
- Update any references to the old documentation locations

## Files Modified/Moved
- Created: 1 new consolidated document
- Archived: 11 documentation files
- Root directory: Reduced from 8 MD files to 1 (PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md)

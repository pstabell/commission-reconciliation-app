## ✅ COMPLETED: Void Visibility Enhancement (Completed July 10, 2025 - Evening)

### Problem Identified
Users couldn't tell which reconciliations had been voided - they all appeared ACTIVE in history.

### Implementation Complete:
1. **Reconciliation History Enhancement**:
   - ✅ Added Status, Void ID, and Void Date columns to By Batch view
   - ✅ Added Reconciliation Status, Batch ID, Is Void Entry to All Transactions view
   - ✅ Implemented color coding for visual identification

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Duplicate Transaction Fix (Completed July 10, 2025 - Evening)

### Critical Issue Resolved
Fixed duplicate transaction creation when editing inline-added records.

### Problem Summary:
- User added new transaction using "Add New Transaction for This Client"
- Transaction saved successfully inline
- When editing that transaction via modal, a duplicate was created instead of updating

### Root Cause:
- Inline-added transactions lacked `_id` field in session state
- Modal save logic only checked `_id` to determine INSERT vs UPDATE
- Without `_id`, system performed INSERT creating duplicate

### Solution Implementation:
- Enhanced modal save logic to check database for existing Transaction ID
- Added fallback query before deciding INSERT vs UPDATE
- System now properly recognizes existing records regardless of `_id` presence

### Impact:
Users can now safely add transactions inline and immediately edit them without creating duplicates. Data integrity maintained throughout the add/edit workflow.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Customer Name Consistency Fix (Completed July 10, 2025 - Evening)

### Reconciliation Import Issue Resolved
Fixed inconsistent customer naming when creating new transactions during statement import.

### Problem Summary:
- Statements had customer names in "Last, First" format (e.g., "Ghosh, Susmit")
- Database had customers in "First Last" format (e.g., "Susmit K. Ghosh")
- New transactions created using statement format instead of existing customer format
- Resulted in duplicate customer entries with different name formats

### Solution Implementation:
- Enhanced transaction creation to check for existing customers before creating new ones
- Uses `find_potential_customer_matches` function which handles name format variations
- If high-confidence match found (90%+), uses existing customer name format
- Only uses statement format if no existing customer found

### Impact:
Reconciliation imports now maintain consistent customer naming throughout the system. Prevents duplicate customer entries and ensures accurate customer-based reporting.

---

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Import Function Parameter Fix (Completed July 10, 2025 - Late Evening)

### Critical Error Resolved
Fixed "name 'all_data' is not defined" error preventing reconciliation imports.

### Implementation:
- Added missing `all_data` parameter to `show_import_results` function
- Ensures customer name matching works during import process
- Maintains access to existing customer data for name consistency

### Impact:
Reconciliation imports now work without errors, maintaining the customer name consistency feature from v3.5.6.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Void Reconciliation Balance Fix (Completed July 10, 2025 - Late Evening)

### Issue Resolved
Fixed calculation so voided reconciliations properly show transactions as unreconciled.

### Solution:
- Updated `calculate_transaction_balances` to include -VOID- entries
- -VOID- entries have negative amounts that properly offset original -STMT- entries
- Ensures voided transactions reappear in Unreconciled Transactions tab

### Impact:
When a reconciliation batch is voided, the affected transactions now correctly show as having outstanding balances again, allowing them to be re-reconciled in future statements.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Manual Transaction Matching (Completed July 11, 2025)

### New Feature
Added manual matching capability for transactions with name mismatches.

### Implementation:
- New "Match transaction" checkbox for unmatched items
- Allows manual matching to existing customers
- Prevents duplicate customer entries
- Handles missing transaction fields gracefully

### Impact:
Significantly improves reconciliation workflow by allowing users to manually resolve customer name mismatches without creating duplicate entries.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Enhanced Reconciliation UI & Client ID Matching (Completed July 12, 2025)

### Major Achievement
Complete overhaul of reconciliation UI with automatic client matching, ensuring all transactions are properly linked to Client IDs.

### Implementation Complete:

1. **Enhanced Reconciliation UI**:
   - ✅ Clear "Force match" labels with transaction ID display
   - ✅ Smart warning system for customer name mismatches (red text)
   - ✅ Improved "Create new transaction" labels showing customer names
   - ✅ Flipped checkbox order - safer "Create new" on left, riskier "Force match" on right
   - ✅ Extended confirmation delay from 2 to 4 seconds

2. **Client ID Matching System**:
   - ✅ Automatic client lookup when creating new transactions
   - ✅ Radio button selection for existing vs new clients
   - ✅ Shows exact matches and similar client names
   - ✅ Creates new client records with auto-generated IDs (CL-XXXXXXXX)
   - ✅ Links all new transactions to appropriate Client IDs

3. **Transactions Requiring Attention**:
   - ✅ New button on Edit Policies page to filter incomplete transactions
   - ✅ Filters transactions with payments but missing premium/commission data
   - ✅ Uses existing edit workflow for quick data completion

4. **Agency Comm Made Optional**:
   - ✅ Moved from required to optional fields in reconciliation
   - ✅ Positioned in right column with other optional fields
   - ✅ Allows reconciliation without agency commission data

### Impact:
Critical improvement to data integrity - all new transactions now have proper Client IDs, enabling accurate client-based reporting and maintaining referential integrity. The enhanced UI prevents errors and provides clear guidance throughout the reconciliation process.

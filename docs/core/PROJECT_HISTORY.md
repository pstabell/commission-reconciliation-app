### Version 3.5.4 (July 10, 2025 - Evening) - Void Visibility Enhancement

#### Background & Problem Discovery
User reported a critical visibility issue: "I voided a reconciliation but it still shows as ACTIVE in Reconciliation History. There's no way to tell which statements have been voided!"

Investigation revealed:
- Void process created reversal entries with Transaction IDs containing `-VOID-` instead of `-STMT-`
- Reconciliation History filter only looked for `-STMT-` transactions
- Void entries were invisible in the history view
- Original batches appeared active despite being voided

#### Comprehensive Solution Implementation

##### 1. Enhanced Reconciliation History Views
**By Batch View** - Added three new columns:
- **Status Column**: Shows ACTIVE, VOIDED, or VOID ENTRY
- **Void ID Column**: Displays the void batch ID for voided reconciliations
- **Void Date Column**: Shows when the reconciliation was voided
- **Color Coding**: Light red background for VOIDED, light orange for VOID ENTRY

**All Transactions View** - Added tracking columns:
- **Reconciliation Status**: Shows RECONCILED or VOID
- **Batch ID**: Links transactions to their batch
- **Is Void Entry**: Yes/No indicator for reversal entries
- **Color Coding**: Visual highlighting for void-related entries

##### 2. Technical Fixes
- **Filter Enhancement**: Changed from single pattern to OR condition:
  ```python
  # Before: only -STMT-
  all_data['Transaction ID'].str.contains('-STMT-', na=False)
  
  # After: both -STMT- and -VOID-
  (all_data['Transaction ID'].str.contains('-STMT-', na=False)) |
  (all_data['Transaction ID'].str.contains('-VOID-', na=False))
  ```

- **Case-Insensitive Handling**: Fixed lowercase 'void' status detection
- **Void Detection Logic**: Enhanced to check multiple indicators:
  - Transaction ID patterns
  - Reconciliation status field
  - Batch ID prefixes

##### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Immediate visual identification of voided reconciliations
- No need to investigate individual transactions
- Clear audit trail of all void operations
- Prevents accidental re-reconciliation of voided statements

#### Discovery Process & Debugging
The issue was discovered through careful analysis of the user's data:
1. User showed void entries existed in All Policy Transactions
2. Transaction IDs followed pattern: `Y355HZ2-VOID-20250710`
3. Reconciliation status was lowercase 'void'
4. Batch ID was `VOID-IMPORT-20250731-3232D7ED`

This led to understanding that the filter was too restrictive and the status comparisons were case-sensitive.

**Impact**: Complete visibility into reconciliation status. Users can now instantly identify which statements are active vs. voided, preventing confusion and potential errors. The enhancement provides a clear audit trail for all reconciliation operations.

### Version 3.5.5 (July 10, 2025 - Evening) - Duplicate Transaction Fix

#### Problem Discovery
User reported: "I'm getting duplicates! 269 U6LPWP 5HR97QP Frank Fanelli Progressive Insurance Private Passenger Auto NEW"

The issue occurred when:
1. User clicked "Add New Transaction for This Client" button
2. Successfully saved the new transaction inline
3. Selected the transaction and clicked "Edit Selected Transaction"
4. Made changes and saved through the modal form
5. Instead of updating, a duplicate record was created

#### Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed the modal save logic issue:
- Inline-added transactions lacked `_id` field in session state (only exists in database)
- Modal save logic only checked for `_id` presence to determine INSERT vs UPDATE
- Without `_id`, the modal assumed it was a new record and performed INSERT
- This created a duplicate with the same Transaction ID but different `_id`

#### Technical Solution
Enhanced the modal save logic with database existence check:
```python
# Before: Only checked _id field
if record_id is not None and record_id != '' and not pd.isna(record_id):
    # UPDATE
else:
    # INSERT

# After: Check database for existing Transaction ID first
existing_record = None
if transaction_id:
    try:
        check_response = supabase.table('policies').select('_id').eq(
            f'"{get_mapped_column("Transaction ID")}"', transaction_id
        ).execute()
        if check_response.data and len(check_response.data) > 0:
            existing_record = check_response.data[0]
    except:
        pass

# Now checks both database and local _id
if existing_record or (record_id is not None and record_id != '' and not pd.isna(record_id)):
    # UPDATE
else:
    # INSERT
```

#### Testing & Verification
1. Added new transaction inline for client U6LPWP
2. Saved successfully with "Save All Changes"
3. Selected and edited the transaction
4. Changes saved correctly without creating duplicate
5. Verified only one record exists with proper updates applied

**Impact**: Users can now safely use the inline add feature followed by immediate editing without creating duplicate records. The system properly recognizes existing records regardless of whether they have `_id` in session state, maintaining data integrity throughout the add/edit workflow.

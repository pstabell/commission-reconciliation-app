### Version 3.5.4 (July 10, 2025 - Evening) - Void Visibility Enhancement

#### Background & Problem Discovery
User reported a critical visibility issue: "I voided a reconciliation but it still shows as ACTIVE in Reconciliation History. There's no way to tell which statements have been voided!"

Investigation revealed:
- Void process created reversal entries with Transaction IDs containing `-VOID-` instead of `-STMT-`
- Reconciliation History filter only looked for `-STMT-` transactions
- Void entries were invisible in the history view
- Original batches appeared active despite being voided

#### Comprehensive Solution Implementation

##### 1. Enhanced Reconciliation History Views
**By Batch View** - Added three new columns:
- **Status Column**: Shows ACTIVE, VOIDED, or VOID ENTRY
- **Void ID Column**: Displays the void batch ID for voided reconciliations
- **Void Date Column**: Shows when the reconciliation was voided
- **Color Coding**: Light red background for VOIDED, light orange for VOID ENTRY

**All Transactions View** - Added tracking columns:
- **Reconciliation Status**: Shows RECONCILED or VOID
- **Batch ID**: Links transactions to their batch
- **Is Void Entry**: Yes/No indicator for reversal entries
- **Color Coding**: Visual highlighting for void-related entries

##### 2. Technical Fixes
- **Filter Enhancement**: Changed from single pattern to OR condition:
  ```python
  # Before: only -STMT-
  all_data['Transaction ID'].str.contains('-STMT-', na=False)
  
  # After: both -STMT- and -VOID-
  (all_data['Transaction ID'].str.contains('-STMT-', na=False)) |
  (all_data['Transaction ID'].str.contains('-VOID-', na=False))
  ```

- **Case-Insensitive Handling**: Fixed lowercase 'void' status detection
- **Void Detection Logic**: Enhanced to check multiple indicators:
  - Transaction ID patterns
  - Reconciliation status field
  - Batch ID prefixes

##### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Immediate visual identification of voided reconciliations
- No need to investigate individual transactions
- Clear audit trail of all void operations
- Prevents accidental re-reconciliation of voided statements

#### Discovery Process & Debugging
The issue was discovered through careful analysis of the user's data:
1. User showed void entries existed in All Policy Transactions
2. Transaction IDs followed pattern: `Y355HZ2-VOID-20250710`
3. Reconciliation status was lowercase 'void'
4. Batch ID was `VOID-IMPORT-20250731-3232D7ED`

This led to understanding that the filter was too restrictive and the status comparisons were case-sensitive.

**Impact**: Complete visibility into reconciliation status. Users can now instantly identify which statements are active vs. voided, preventing confusion and potential errors. The enhancement provides a clear audit trail for all reconciliation operations.

### Version 3.5.5 (July 10, 2025 - Evening) - Duplicate Transaction Fix

#### Problem Discovery
User reported: "I'm getting duplicates! 269 U6LPWP 5HR97QP Frank Fanelli Progressive Insurance Private Passenger Auto NEW"

The issue occurred when:
1. User clicked "Add New Transaction for This Client" button
2. Successfully saved the new transaction inline
3. Selected the transaction and clicked "Edit Selected Transaction"
4. Made changes and saved through the modal form
5. Instead of updating, a duplicate record was created

#### Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed the modal save logic issue:
- Inline-added transactions lacked `_id` field in session state (only exists in database)
- Modal save logic only checked for `_id` presence to determine INSERT vs UPDATE
- Without `_id`, the modal assumed it was a new record and performed INSERT
- This created a duplicate with the same Transaction ID but different `_id`

#### Technical Solution
Enhanced the modal save logic with database existence check:
```python
# Before: Only checked _id field
if record_id is not None and record_id != '' and not pd.isna(record_id):
    # UPDATE
else:
    # INSERT

# After: Check database for existing Transaction ID first
existing_record = None
if transaction_id:
    try:
        check_response = supabase.table('policies').select('_id').eq(
            f'"{get_mapped_column("Transaction ID")}"', transaction_id
        ).execute()
        if check_response.data and len(check_response.data) > 0:
            existing_record = check_response.data[0]
    except:
        pass

# Now checks both database and local _id
if existing_record or (record_id is not None and record_id != '' and not pd.isna(record_id)):
    # UPDATE
else:
    # INSERT
```

#### Testing & Verification
1. Added new transaction inline for client U6LPWP
2. Saved successfully with "Save All Changes"
3. Selected and edited the transaction
4. Changes saved correctly without creating duplicate
5. Verified only one record exists with proper updates applied

**Impact**: Users can now safely use the inline add feature followed by immediate editing without creating duplicate records. The system properly recognizes existing records regardless of whether they have `_id` in session state, maintaining data integrity throughout the add/edit workflow.

### Version 3.5.6 (July 10, 2025 - Evening) - Customer Name Consistency Fix

#### Problem Discovery
User reported inconsistent customer naming in reconciled transactions:
- Statement entries showed "Ghosh, Susmit" (Last, First format)
- Database had "Susmit K. Ghosh" (First Last format)
- New transactions created with statement format instead of existing customer format
- Multiple "Lat 26 Enterprises, Inc." entries created despite existing customer

Example reconciliation results:
```
68I4T3Y-STMT-20240831    Ghosh, Susmit    NAA3678880
PB891F3-STMT-20240831    Susmit K. Ghosh    FPH5549526-00
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
Investigation revealed:
1. The `find_potential_customer_matches` function correctly handled "Last, First" format matching
2. When creating new transactions during import, the system used the statement's customer name format
3. This happened even when a matching customer already existed in the database
4. Result: Same customer with different name formats across transactions

#### Technical Solution
Enhanced the transaction creation logic in reconciliation import:
```python
# Before: Always used statement customer name
'Customer': item['customer'],

# After: Check for existing customer first
final_customer_name = item['customer']
if not all_data.empty:
    all_customers = all_data['Customer'].dropna().unique().tolist()
    potential_matches = find_potential_customer_matches(item['customer'], all_customers)
    if potential_matches and potential_matches[0][2] >= 90:  # High confidence match
        final_customer_name = potential_matches[0][0]  # Use existing customer name format

'Customer': final_customer_name,
```

#### Implementation Details
1. Before creating any new transaction, system now checks for existing customers
2. Uses the same matching logic that handles various name formats
3. If high-confidence match found (90%+), uses existing customer name
4. Only uses statement format if no existing customer found
5. Ensures consistency across all transaction records

#### Testing & Verification
The fix ensures:
- "Ghosh, Susmit" from statement ‚Üí "Susmit K. Ghosh" in new transaction
- "Lat 26 Enterprises, Inc." uses consistent format across all entries
- No duplicate customer entries with different formats
- Better data integrity and reporting accuracy

**Impact**: Reconciliation imports now maintain consistent customer naming conventions throughout the system. This prevents duplicate customer entries, ensures accurate customer-based reporting, and maintains data integrity when importing statements with different name formatting conventions.

### Version 3.9.38 (August 8, 2025) - X-DATE Orphan Rules & MGA Refresh Enhancement

Major policy term assignment rule changes implementing strict X-DATE boundary handling and improved MGA dropdown functionality:

#### X-DATE Orphan Transaction Rules
- **Strict Boundary Implementation**:
  - Transactions with Effective Date = X-DATE now become orphans
  - Forces proper renewal policy term entry for boundary transactions
  - Prevents ambiguous term assignments at policy boundaries
  - NO EXCEPTIONS - ensures data integrity

- **Visual Orphan Indicators**:
  - Orphan transactions appear at top of Policy Revenue Ledger
  - Header/footer rows with solid block separators (‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà)
  - Red warning message: "ORPHANED TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE RWL POLICY TERM!"
  - All non-customer cells filled with solid blocks for strong visual impact
  - Creates unmistakable visual barrier requiring user attention

- **STMT Date Filtering Fix**:
  - Changed from STMT DATE to Effective Date for term assignment
  - Ensures STMT transactions stay with their policy terms
  - Consistent date handling across all transaction types

#### MGA Dropdown Enhancement
- **Refresh Button Addition**:
  - Added üîÑ Refresh button next to MGA dropdown in Edit Transaction form
  - Clears all MGA caches (keys starting with 'mgas_for_carrier_')
  - Immediate visibility of newly created commission rules
  - Resolves issue where Johnson and Johnson MGA wasn't showing for Evanston Insurance

- **Cache Management**:
  - Commission rule creation already clears specific carrier cache
  - New refresh button provides manual cache clearing option
  - Ensures commission rule ‚Üí MGA associations always current

#### Technical Implementation
- **Term Assignment Logic**:
  - Modified comparison operators from <= to < for X-DATE (lines 15711, 15717, 15723)
  - Orphan detection: transactions where effective_date == term_x_date
  - Visual styling with cell-specific formatting (red text for customer, white for others)

- **Session State Management**:
  - Comprehensive MGA cache clearing on refresh
  - Success message with brief pause for user feedback
  - Automatic page rerun to reload fresh data

**Impact**: Enforces clear policy term boundaries preventing ambiguous transaction assignments. Orphaned transactions require explicit renewal term creation, improving data quality. MGA refresh capability ensures immediate access to newly created commission rules without manual cache management.

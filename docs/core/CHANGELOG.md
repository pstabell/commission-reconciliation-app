## [3.6.5] - 2025-07-15 - Void Date Extraction Fix

### Fixed
- **Void Transactions Date Issue**
  - Fixed void transactions using current date instead of statement date
  - Issue: Void entries created with today's date, making them invisible in historical views
  - Root cause: Date extraction only handled IMPORT- prefix, not REC- or MNL- formats
  - Solution: Enhanced to use regex pattern `-(\d{8})-` to extract date from any batch ID
  - Now supports all batch formats: IMPORT-YYYYMMDD-X, REC-YYYYMMDD-X, MNL-YYYYMMDD-X
  - Both Transaction ID suffix and STMT DATE now use correct statement date
  - Impact: Void transactions appear in correct time period in reconciliation history

### Technical
- Replaced hardcoded prefix checks with flexible regex pattern matching
- Extracts YYYYMMDD pattern from any position in batch ID
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing batch formats

- -VOID- entries have negative amounts that properly offset original -STMT- entries
- Ensures voided transactions reappear in Unreconciled Transactions tab

### Impact
When a reconciliation batch is voided, the affected transactions now correctly show as having outstanding balances again, allowing them to be re-reconciled in future statements.

## [3.5.7] - 2025-07-10 (Late Evening) - Import Function Parameter Fix

  - Prevents duplicate customer entries with different name formats

### Technical
- Enhanced transaction creation logic to use `find_potential_customer_matches`
- Added customer name normalization for "Last, First" format matching
- Maintains data integrity by using consistent customer names across all transactions

### Impact

### Technical
- Modified reconciliation entry filter from single pattern to OR condition
- Added case-insensitive string comparisons throughout void detection
- Improved batch status aggregation logic

### Impact
Users can now clearly see which reconciliations have been voided without investigating individual transactions. The reconciliation history provides complete visibility into the status of all statements, preventing confusion about which are active vs. voided.

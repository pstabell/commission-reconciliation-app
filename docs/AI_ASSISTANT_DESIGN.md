# AI Assistant Integration Design Document

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the design for integrating an AI chat assistant into the Sales Commission App to help users navigate and use the application effectively.

## Objectives
- Provide real-time, context-aware help to users
- Reduce support tickets and training time
- Improve user experience and feature discovery
- Act as a knowledgeable customer service representative

## Recommended Approach: Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Popup Help Bot (Low Risk)
Start with an isolated help button that opens a modal chat interface.

**Advantages:**
- Minimal impact on existing code
- Easy to disable/remove
- Can test AI effectiveness
- Monitor costs and usage

**Implementation:**
```python
# New file: ai_help_bot.py
# Completely separate from main app
# Called only when help button clicked
```

### Phase 2: Integrated Sidebar Assistant (If Phase 1 Successful)
Upgrade to contextual sidebar assistant after proving value.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **AI Service Layer**
   - OpenAI/Anthropic API integration
   - Rate limiting and cost controls
   - Error handling and fallbacks

2. **Context Collection**
   - Current page identification
   - Active filters and selections
   - Recent user actions
   - Visible data summaries

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - App documentation
   - Feature descriptions
   - Common workflows
   - Troubleshooting guides

### Sample Context Payload
```json
{
  "current_page": "Edit Policy Transactions",
  "user_selections": {
    "mga_filter": "Kingsbridge",
    "date_range": "2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31",
    "selected_rows": 3
  },
  "recent_actions": [
    "Applied MGA filter",
    "Selected 3 transactions",
    "Clicked Edit button"
  ],
  "visible_features": [
    "Edit modal",
    "Delete button",
    "Save changes"
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 Steps (2-3 weeks)
1. Create `ai_help_bot.py` module
2. Add help button to main navigation
3. Implement basic chat UI in modal
4. Connect to AI API with rate limiting
5. Create initial knowledge base
6. Test with small user group

### Phase 2 Steps (If proceeding)
1. Move chat to sidebar
2. Add real-time context collection
3. Enhance knowledge base
4. Implement learning from interactions
5. Add analytics dashboard

## Cost Estimation
- **API Costs**: ~$50-200/month (depends on usage)
- **Development**: 40-80 hours
- **Maintenance**: 5-10 hours/month

## Risk Mitigation & Rollback Plan

### Feature Flags
```python
# config.py
AI_ASSISTANT_ENABLED = True  # Easy on/off switch
AI_ASSISTANT_MODE = "popup"  # "popup" or "sidebar"
```

### Rollback Strategy
1. **Immediate Disable**: Single config flag turns off feature
2. **Code Isolation**: All AI code in separate modules
3. **Database**: No database changes required
4. **Clean Removal**: Can delete AI modules without affecting app

### Monitoring & Kill Switches
```python
# Built-in safeguards
MAX_DAILY_API_CALLS = 1000
MAX_COST_PER_DAY = 10.00
EMERGENCY_SHUTOFF = False  # Can set via environment variable
```

## Success Metrics
- User engagement rate (% using assistant)
- Successful query resolution rate
- Reduction in support tickets
- User satisfaction scores
- Cost per interaction

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: High API Costs
**Solution**: Implement caching, rate limiting, and usage quotas

### Issue: Incorrect Advice
**Solution**: Add disclaimer, limit to documented features only

### Issue: Performance Impact
**Solution**: Async API calls, lazy loading, separate thread

### Issue: Privacy Concerns
**Solution**: No user data sent to AI, only app context

## Sample Interactions

### Example 1: Edit Page Help
**User**: "How do I edit multiple transactions at once?"

**AI**: "I see you're on the Edit Policy Transactions page. To edit multiple transactions:
1. Check the 'Select' checkbox for each transaction you want to edit
2. You can edit them one at a time using the Edit button
3. For bulk updates, consider using the search filters to narrow down your selection first
Note: You can only edit one transaction at a time in the modal."

### Example 2: Reconciliation Help
**User**: "What does -STMT- mean?"

**AI**: "The -STMT- suffix indicates a statement transaction from your reconciliation process. These are protected records that cannot be deleted, serving as your audit trail. They're created when you import bank or commission statements on the Reconciliation page."

## Security Considerations
- API keys stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data in AI prompts
- User permissions checked before providing information
- Audit log of AI interactions

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve design
2. Set up development environment
3. Create proof of concept
4. User testing group selection
5. Phased rollout plan

## Conclusion
This phased approach minimizes risk while providing maximum value. The ability to completely disable or remove the feature ensures no long-term liability while allowing for innovation and improved user experience.

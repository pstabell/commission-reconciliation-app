# Contacts & Commission Structure Feature Plan

**Created**: July 13, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Purpose**: Design a comprehensive carrier/MGA commission rule system

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Create a new "Contacts" page with tabs for Carriers and MGAs, implementing a flexible rule-based commission structure that automatically calculates commission rates based on carrier, MGA, state, policy type, and term.

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### New Tables Required

#### 1. `carriers` table
```sql
- carrier_id (UUID, Primary Key)
- carrier_name (Text, Unique)
- naic_code (Text)
- producer_code (Text)
- parent_company (Text)
- status (Text: 'Active'/'Inactive')
- notes (Text)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
```

#### 2. `mgas` table
```sql
- mga_id (UUID, Primary Key)
- mga_name (Text, Unique)
- contact_info (JSONB)
- appointment_date (Date)
- status (Text: 'Active'/'Inactive')
- notes (Text)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
```

#### 3. `carrier_mga_relationships` table
```sql
- relationship_id (UUID, Primary Key)
- carrier_id (UUID, Foreign Key → carriers)
- mga_id (UUID, Foreign Key → mgas)
- is_direct (Boolean, default false)
- created_at (Timestamp)
```

#### 4. `commission_rules` table
```sql
- rule_id (UUID, Primary Key)
- carrier_id (UUID, Foreign Key → carriers)
- mga_id (UUID, Foreign Key → mgas, nullable)
- state (Text, nullable, default 'FL')
- policy_type (Text, nullable)
- term_months (Integer, nullable)
- new_rate (Decimal, required)
- renewal_rate (Decimal, nullable - uses new_rate if null)
- payment_terms (Text, nullable: 'Advanced'/'As Earned')
- rule_description (Text)
- rule_priority (Integer, calculated)
- is_default (Boolean)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
```

### Updates to Existing Tables

#### `policies` table - Add columns (All NULLABLE for backward compatibility):
- `carrier_id` (UUID, Foreign Key → carriers, nullable)
- `mga_id` (UUID, Foreign Key → mgas, nullable)
- `commission_rule_id` (UUID, Foreign Key → commission_rules, nullable)
- `commission_rate_override` (Decimal, nullable)

**Note**: All new columns are nullable to ensure existing records continue to function without modification.

## 🔄 Impacted Pages & Components

### 1. **Navigation Menu** 
- Add "Contacts" to sidebar navigation
- Position after "Tools" or before "Help"

### 2. **New Page: Contacts**

#### Structure:
```
Contacts
├── Tab: Carriers
│   ├── Carrier List/Search
│   ├── Add New Carrier button
│   ├── Edit Carrier (inline or modal)
│   └── Commission Rules Management
└── Tab: MGAs
    ├── MGA List/Search
    ├── Add New MGA button
    ├── Edit MGA (inline or modal)
    └── Carrier Associations
```

### 3. **Add New Policy Transaction** (Major Impact)

#### Current State:
- Manual entry of commission rates
- User types in Policy Gross Comm % and Agent Comm %
- Carrier Name and MGA Name are free text fields

#### Future State:
- Add Carrier dropdown (required) - searchable with existing carriers
- Add MGA dropdown (optional, filtered by carrier relationships)
- If no MGA relationship exists, show "Direct Appointment" option
- Auto-populate commission rates based on:
  - Selected Carrier
  - Selected MGA (or Direct)
  - Policy Type (from existing dropdown)
  - Transaction Type (NEW vs RWL)
- Show which rule is being applied (e.g., "Using: Citizens Direct DP3 - 20%")
- Allow manual override with warning and reason capture

#### UI Changes:
```
Policy Information
├── [NEW] Carrier Name* [Searchable Dropdown - Select Carrier]
│   └── Features: Type-ahead search, case-insensitive, partial matching
├── [NEW] MGA Name [Searchable Dropdown - Select MGA or "Direct"]
│   └── Features: Filtered by carrier, searchable, includes "Direct" option
├── Policy Type* [Existing dropdown]
├── Carrier Name [REMOVE - replaced by dropdown above]
├── MGA Name [REMOVE - replaced by dropdown above]
└── ... other fields ...

Commission Details
├── Policy Gross Comm % [Auto-populated, editable]
├── [NEW] Applied Rule: "Carrier Default (15%)" [Info text]
├── [NEW] ⚠️ Override Commission [Checkbox]
└── ... calculated fields ...
```

### 4. **Edit Policy Transactions** (Major Impact)

#### Changes:
- Add Carrier/MGA dropdowns
- Show current rule vs override status
- Option to "Reset to Rule Rate"
- Warning if rate differs from current rule

### 5. **Reports Page** (Minor Impact)

#### New Report: Commission Rule Audit
```
Commission Rule Audit Report
├── Policies using rule-based rates: 450 (90%)
├── Policies with manual overrides: 50 (10%)
├── Policies missing carrier assignment: 15
└── Rule usage breakdown by carrier/MGA
```

### 6. **Dashboard** (Minor Impact)

#### Potential Addition:
- Commission rule coverage metric
- Alert for policies without carrier assignment

### 7. **Import Statement** (Moderate Impact)

#### Enhancement:
- Map carrier names during import
- Auto-assign carrier_id based on mapping
- Apply commission rules to imported transactions

## 🏝️ Island Architecture Implementation

### Page Isolation Strategy

The Contacts page will be built as a completely isolated island, following the established patterns in the application architecture:

#### 1. **Independent Page Structure**
```python
# In main navigation section
elif page == "Contacts":
    # Load fresh data for this page
    all_data = load_policies_data()
    carriers_data = load_carriers_data()  # New isolated data
    mgas_data = load_mgas_data()         # New isolated data
    
    # All Contacts functionality contained here
    # No shared state with other pages
    # Complete isolation from rest of app
```

#### 2. **Data Loading Pattern**
Following the v3.5.1 architecture pattern:
- Each page loads fresh data independently
- No stale data issues between pages
- Contacts page has its own data queries
- No interference with existing data loading

#### 3. **Error Containment**
- Errors in Contacts page stay isolated
- Try/except blocks contain all failures
- Other pages continue functioning normally
- No cascading failures possible

#### 4. **Future Modular Architecture Ready**
Designed to fit the planned modular structure:
```
pages/
  ├── dashboard.py
  ├── reports.py
  ├── contacts.py    # NEW - isolated module
  ├── all_policies.py
  └── ...
```

#### 5. **No Cross-Page Dependencies**
- Contacts page doesn't import from other pages
- Other pages don't import from Contacts
- Shared utilities only (database, formatting)
- Clean separation of concerns

## 🔧 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - Zero Impact on Existing Features
1. Create new database tables (additive only)
   - No modifications to existing tables
   - No data migration required
2. Add Contacts page to navigation menu
   - New menu item only, no changes to existing pages
3. Build Contacts page structure
   - Completely isolated new functionality
4. Implement Carriers tab with CRUD operations
5. Basic commission rule creation (default rules only)

### Phase 2: MGA Integration (Week 2) - No Impact on Core App
1. Implement MGAs tab
2. Create carrier-MGA relationships
3. Add MGA-specific commission rules
4. Test rule hierarchy/priority
5. All functionality contained within Contacts page

### Phase 3: Policy Integration (Week 3) - Backward Compatible
1. Add optional carrier_id/mga_id columns to policies table
   - Nullable columns, no impact on existing records
2. Update Add New Policy form
   - Add searchable dropdowns alongside existing text fields
   - Manual entry remains default option
   - Commission auto-population is optional
3. Implement auto-population logic with fallback
   - If carrier selected: use rules
   - If no carrier: use manual entry (current behavior)
4. Update Edit Policy form
   - Show both dropdown and manual options
   - Preserve all existing functionality

### Phase 4: Reporting & Import (Week 4) - Enhancement Only
1. Create Commission Rule Audit report
   - New report, doesn't modify existing reports
2. Update statement import for carrier mapping
   - Optional feature with manual override
3. Add bulk operations (optional)
4. Testing and refinement

## 📐 Rule Priority Logic

Priority calculation (higher number = higher priority):
```python
def calculate_rule_priority(rule):
    priority = 0
    if rule.mga_id:
        priority += 1000
    if rule.state:
        priority += 100
    if rule.policy_type:
        priority += 10
    if rule.term_months:
        priority += 1
    return priority
```

Example priorities:
- Carrier default: 0
- Carrier + State: 100
- Carrier + Policy Type: 10
- Carrier + MGA: 1000
- Carrier + MGA + State + Policy Type: 1110

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations

### Searchable Dropdown Implementation
```python
# Carrier dropdown with search
carrier_names = ["Progressive Insurance", "State Farm", "Allstate", ...]
selected_carrier = st.selectbox(
    "Carrier Name*",
    options=[""] + sorted(carrier_names),
    format_func=lambda x: "Select Carrier..." if x == "" else x,
    help="Type to search carriers"
)

# MGA dropdown with dynamic filtering
if selected_carrier:
    mga_options = ["Direct Appointment"] + get_mgas_for_carrier(selected_carrier)
    selected_mga = st.selectbox(
        "MGA Name",
        options=mga_options,
        help="Type to search MGAs"
    )
```

### Search Features
- **Type-ahead filtering**: Results update as user types
- **Case-insensitive matching**: "prog" matches "Progressive"
- **Partial string matching**: "state" matches "State Farm"
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys + Enter for selection
- **Clear button**: X button to clear selection
- **Recent selections**: Optional - show last 5 used at top

### Carrier Commission Rules Interface
```
Citizens Property Insurance
├── Default Commission: NEW: [10%] RWL: [10%] ✏️
└── Payment Terms: As Earned
    
Progressive Insurance
├── Default Commission: [No Default - Product Specific]
└── Specific Rules: [+ Add Rule]
    ├── Direct, Type: Auto ➜ NEW: [12%] RWL: [12%] 🗑️
    ├── Direct, Type: Boat ➜ NEW: [10%] RWL: [10%] 🗑️
    └── Direct, Type: Renters ➜ NEW: [15%] RWL: [15%] 🗑️
    
AAA Insurance
├── Default Commission: [No Default - Product Specific]
└── Specific Rules: [+ Add Rule]
    ├── Direct, Type: Home, Membership ➜ NEW: [15%] RWL: [15%] 🗑️
    ├── Direct, Type: Auto, Package ➜ NEW: [12%] RWL: [12%] 🗑️
    └── Direct, Type: Umbrella ➜ NEW: [10%] RWL: [10%] 🗑️
```

### Commission Rule Entry Form
```
Add Commission Rule for: Progressive Insurance

[✓] Direct Appointment  [ ] MGA Relationship

MGA: [Disabled - Direct Selected]

Policy Types: [✓] Auto  [ ] Boat  [ ] Renters  [ ] Other: _____
             (Check all that apply)

NEW Business Rate: [12] %
Renewal Rate: [12] % (leave blank to use NEW rate)

Payment Terms: 
  [ ] Advanced  [✓] As Earned

Rule Description: Auto mono-line at 12% (Progressive doesn't sell home in FL)

[Save Rule] [Cancel]
```

### Rule Validation
- Prevent duplicate rules
- Warn on overlapping rules
- Show rule conflicts visually
- Validate commission percentages (0-100%)

### Visual Feedback
- Color-code rules by type
- Show inheritance chain
- Preview rule application
- Highlight overrides in red

## 🛡️ Preservation of Existing Functionality

### 1. **Additive Development Approach**
- All new features are additions, not modifications
- Existing commission calculation logic untouched
- Current manual entry workflow remains available
- No breaking changes to database schema

### 2. **Backward Compatibility Strategy**
```
Current State → Transition Period → Future State
- Manual entry → Manual + Dropdown → Dropdown preferred
- Text fields → Text + Searchable → Searchable primary
- No rules → Optional rules → Rules recommended
```

### 3. **Feature Flags for Gradual Rollout**
```python
# Enable new features progressively
if st.session_state.get('enable_carrier_dropdowns', False):
    # Show new dropdown
    carrier = st.selectbox("Carrier", carriers)
else:
    # Show existing text field
    carrier = st.text_input("Carrier Name")
```

### 4. **Data Preservation Guarantees**
- Existing policies unchanged
- Historical commission rates preserved
- Manual overrides always available
- No forced migrations

## 🔧 Admin Panel Enhancement Requirements

### Missing Features Analysis
The Admin Panel previously had robust column management features that were removed in recent versions. To properly support the Contacts feature and maintain system flexibility, we need to restore key functionality:

#### Currently Missing (Found in Backups):
1. **Add Database Columns** - Simple form to add new columns
2. **Delete Database Columns** - Two-step confirmation process
3. **Rename Column Headers** - Dropdown selection with rename capability
4. **Enhanced Policy Types Management** - Add/edit/toggle active status
5. **Column Mapping Configuration** - Visual mapping with health metrics

#### Required for Contacts Feature:
1. **Policy Types Management** (Critical)
   - Add new policy types (e.g., "Cyber", "Professional Liability")
   - Edit existing policy type names
   - Set active/inactive status
   - No delete function (preserve data integrity)

2. **Transaction Types Management** (Nice to have)
   - View existing types
   - Add new transaction types if needed
   - Edit display names

3. **Dropdown List Management** (Future consideration)
   - Centralized management for all dropdown fields
   - Add/edit options without code changes

### Selected Implementation: Configuration File Approach
**Why This Is Safest:**
- No risk of accidental database schema corruption
- Changes require deliberate file edits
- Easy to backup/restore configuration files
- Clear audit trail of changes

**Modern UI Design Principles:**
- Compact, card-based layouts (not long forms)
- Visual feedback with icons and colors
- Grouped related functions together
- Consistent with current v3.5.6 styling
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

**Configuration Files Structure:**
```
config_files/
├── policy_types.json          # Policy type definitions
├── transaction_types.json     # Transaction type options
├── carriers.json             # Pre-populated carrier list
└── dropdown_options.json     # Other dropdown configurations
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. **No Retroactive Updates**
- New rules apply to policies created after rule date
- Existing policies keep their original rates
- Optional bulk update with explicit consent

### 2. **Data Migration Strategy**

#### Initial Carrier Import from Excel:
1. **Unique Carriers Identified**: 22 distinct carriers
   - Examples: Citizens Property, Progressive, Olympus, SafePoint
2. **Unique MGAs Identified**: 11 distinct MGAs
   - Examples: SureTec, FAIA, TWFG-Frenkel, Tower Hill Signature
3. **Direct Appointments**: Will be marked when MGA column is empty

#### Migration Steps:
1. **Phase 1 - Carrier Creation**:
   - Import carriers from Excel (Citizens, Progressive, AAA, etc.)
   - Set all as Active status
   - Generate unique IDs
   - Note mono-line vs multi-line carriers

2. **Phase 2 - MGA Creation**:
   - Import MGAs (Advantage Partners, Burns & Wilcox, BTIS, etc.)
   - Create relationships with carriers (e.g., Mercury-Advantage Partners)
   - Mark direct appointments (majority of entries)

3. **Phase 3 - Rule Creation**:
   - Simple defaults: Citizens (10%/10%), Neptune (12%/12%)
   - Product-specific: Progressive (Auto 12%, Boat 10%, Renters 15%)
   - Complex multi-line: AAA (Home 15%, Auto 12%, Umbrella 10%)
   - Handle blank RWL rates (default to NEW)
   - Add payment term notes

4. **Phase 4 - Existing Data Mapping**:
   - Parse existing Carrier Name field in policies
   - Match to imported carriers (case-insensitive)
   - Update policies with carrier_id
   - Log any unmatched carriers for manual review

### 3. **Override Tracking**
- Store both calculated and actual rates
- Flag manual overrides for reporting
- Maintain override reason/notes

### 4. **MGA Complexity**
- Some carriers may have 10+ MGAs
- Need efficient MGA selection UI
- Consider MGA groups/categories

### 5. **Configuration File Management**
- All dropdown options in JSON files
- Admin Panel shows read-only view with download option
- Clear documentation for manual editing
- Validation on app startup to catch JSON errors

### 5. **Parallel Operation Period**
- Both old and new systems work simultaneously
- Users can choose their preferred method
- Gradual transition based on user readiness
- No forced adoption timeline

### 6. **Island Architecture Benefits**
Based on the app's documented architecture principles:
- **Bulletproof Design**: Contacts page failure cannot crash other pages
- **Contained Errors**: Issues isolated to Contacts module only
- **Independent Development**: Can be built without touching other code
- **Easy Debugging**: Problems pinpointed to Contacts page immediately
- **Single Responsibility**: Contacts page has one clear purpose
- **No Merge Conflicts**: Changes don't affect other pages' code

## 🔍 Search & Filter Requirements

### Carriers Page
- Search by: Name, NAIC code, producer code
- Filter by: Active/inactive, has MGAs, parent company
- Sort by: Name, creation date, rule count

### Commission Rules
- Search by: Rate, state, policy type
- Filter by: Default/specific, MGA rules
- Sort by: Priority, rate, creation date

### Dropdown Search Functionality
- **Add/Edit Policy Forms**:
  - Carrier dropdown: Search through all active carriers
  - MGA dropdown: Search through MGAs linked to selected carrier
  - Both support type-ahead search with instant filtering
  - Show match count: "Showing 5 of 127 carriers"
  
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Load carrier list once on page load
  - Cache MGA relationships
  - Limit dropdown display to 50 items (with search to find more)
  - Lazy load additional results as user scrolls

## 📊 Real-World Data Insights (from Excel Analysis)

### Commission Structure Patterns
Based on analysis of 46 carrier/MGA combinations:

1. **Complex Rate Structures**:
   - Many carriers have different rates for different policy types
   - Example: AAA has 15% for Home/Membership, 12% for Auto/Package, 10% for Umbrella
   - Progressive is mono-line in FL (Auto only at 12%)
   - Some carriers specialize in specific product lines

2. **Direct vs MGA Relationships**:
   - 28 Direct Appointments (no MGA)
   - 18 MGA relationships
   - Direct appointments often have higher commission rates

3. **Commission Rate Ranges**:
   - NEW rates: 6% to 20% (Citizens at 10%, Progressive Auto at 12%)
   - RWL rates: 6% to 15% (often lower than NEW)
   - Common pattern: RWL = NEW - 2% to 4%
   - Some carriers maintain same rate (Citizens: 10%/10%)
   - Blank RWL rates default to NEW rate

4. **Policy Type Coverage**:
   - Personal Auto: Common product line
   - Home: HO3, HO6, DP1, DP3, etc.
   - Commercial: Workers Comp (WC), General Liability (GL), BOP
   - Specialty: Flood, Boat, Renters, Umbrella, Cyber
   - Some carriers specialize in specific product lines

5. **Payment Terms & Special Notes**:
   - Advanced: Commission paid upfront
   - As Earned: Commission paid over policy term  
   - Special conditions: "pays based on insured's payment plan"
   - Some carriers: "pays on full premium"
   - Important for cash flow management and reconciliation

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Rule Flexibility Required**:
   - Single carrier/MGA combo may need multiple rules
   - Policy type field must support multiple selections
   - Consider "rule groups" for complex carriers

2. **Data Entry Optimization**:
   - Bulk rule creation for carriers with many policy types
   - Template system for common rate structures
   - Clone functionality for similar rules

3. **User Experience**:
   - Show applicable rules when selecting policy
   - Clear indication of which rule is being applied
   - Easy override mechanism for exceptions

## 📊 Success Metrics

1. **Automation Rate**: % of policies using rule-based rates
2. **Time Savings**: Reduced time on Add Policy form
3. **Accuracy**: Fewer commission calculation errors
4. **Coverage**: % of policies with carrier assignment
5. **Rule Utilization**: Which rules are used most frequently
6. **Override Frequency**: Track manual overrides to identify missing rules

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Rule Templates**: Copy rules between similar carriers
2. **Bulk Rule Updates**: Update multiple rules at once
3. **Rule History**: Track changes to commission rates
4. **API Integration**: Import carrier data from external sources
5. **Commission Tiers**: Support volume-based commission rates
6. **Multi-State Support**: Expand beyond Florida when needed
7. **Rule Import**: Bulk import from Excel spreadsheets
8. **Commission Reconciliation**: Match expected vs actual rates
9. **Rate Change Notifications**: Alert when carrier rates change
10. **Policy Type Grouping**: Create reusable policy type combinations

## 💡 Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Embedded in Policy Form**: Rejected - too complex for inline editing
2. **Separate Commission App**: Rejected - needs tight integration
3. **Simple Rate Table**: Rejected - insufficient flexibility
4. **JSON Configuration**: Rejected - not user-friendly

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If any issues arise during implementation:

1. **Phase 1-2**: Simply hide Contacts menu item
2. **Phase 3**: Disable carrier dropdowns via feature flag
3. **Phase 4**: Revert to original import process
4. **Database**: New tables can be dropped without impact
5. **Policies table**: New nullable columns can remain or be dropped

All changes are designed to be reversible without data loss.

### Contacts Page Structure
```python
# Contacts page will follow the established pattern
def show_contacts_page():
    """Isolated Contacts page following app architecture patterns"""
    try:
        # Independent data loading

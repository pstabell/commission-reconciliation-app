## Form Behavior

### Real-time Calculations
When user enters or changes:
1. **Premium Sold or Policy Taxes & Fees**:
   - Update Commissionable Premium
   - Recalculate Agency Est. Comm/Revenue
   - Recalculate Agent Estimated Comm $
   - Update Total Agent Comm

2. **Broker Fee**:
   - Calculate Broker Fee Agent Comm (always 50%)
   - Update Total Agent Comm

3. **Policy Gross Comm %**:
   - Recalculate Agency Est. Comm/Revenue
   - Recalculate Agent Estimated Comm $
   - Update Total Agent Comm

### Validation Rules
1. **Premium Sold** â‰¥ **Policy Taxes & Fees**
2. All monetary fields must be â‰¥ 0
3. Policy Gross Comm % must be between 0-100
4. Commissionable Premium cannot be negative

### Error Messages
- "Policy Taxes & Fees cannot exceed Premium Sold"
- "Broker Fee must be a positive number or zero"
- "Commission percentage must be between 0 and 100"

## Migration Considerations

### For Existing Forms
1. Add new section between Policy Information and Commission Details
2. Move some fields to create logical groupings
3. Update Commission Details section layout
4. Add new calculated fields

### For Edit Policy Form
- Same layout changes as Add Policy form
- Maintain existing edit/lock behaviors
- New fields follow same protection rules

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Small Screens (< 768px)
- Stack all fields in single column
- Maintain section groupings
- Show calculated fields below inputs
- Keep visual indicators visible

### Medium Screens (768px - 1024px)
- Maintain two-column layout where possible
- May stack Premium & Fee section
- Preserve field relationships

## Implementation Notes

### Database Requirements
- Migration script to add new columns
- Default values for existing records
- Update all queries to include new fields

### Calculation Engine
- Update formula functions
- Add broker fee calculation (always 50%)
- Modify commission calculations to use Commissionable Premium

### Testing Requirements
1. Test all calculation scenarios
2. Verify validation rules
3. Test with $0 broker fees
4. Test with taxes exceeding premium (should error)
5. Test mobile layouts

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: All calculations produce correct results
2. **Clarity**: Users understand new fields without training
3. **Efficiency**: Form completion time remains similar
4. **Consistency**: Matches existing form patterns

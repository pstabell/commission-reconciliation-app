## The Power of the Shelf

Every item on this shelf:
1. **Can be sold before it's built** (demo shows capability)
2. **Has a clear price** (customer knows investment)
3. **Has a timeline** (customer knows when)
4. **Becomes an asset** (reuse for next customer)
5. **Generates recurring revenue** (monthly fees)

The key: Build only when paid, but know exactly what to build when the time comes!

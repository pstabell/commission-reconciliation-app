# Field Label Updates Summary

**Created**: January 8, 2025  
**Purpose**: Document all field label updates for improved clarity

## Overview

This document summarizes all field label changes made to improve user experience and clarity in the commission tracking application.

## Label Changes Implemented

### 1. Premium Entry Fields

**Old Label**: "Enter Premium Sold and see Agency Revenue"  
**New Label**: "New Policy Premium"  
**Reason**: More concise and clear purpose

### 2. Section Names

**Old Name**: "Premium & Fee Information"  
**New Name**: "Broker Fee / Carrier Taxes & Fees"  
**Reason**: Better describes the section's actual purpose - entering fees and taxes, not premium

### 3. Tax/Fee Fields

**Old Label**: "Policy Taxes & Fees"  
**New Label**: "Carrier Taxes & Fees"  
**Reason**: Clarifies that these are carrier-imposed taxes/fees, not broker fees

### 4. CSS Comments

**Old Comment**: "Add yellow border to Enter Premium Sold and see Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM) input"  
**New Comment**: "Add yellow border to New Policy Premium input"  
**Reason**: Consistency with new field naming

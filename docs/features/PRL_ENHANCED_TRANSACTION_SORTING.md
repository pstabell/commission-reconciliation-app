# Policy Revenue Ledger Reports - Enhanced Transaction Sorting

## Date: August 3, 2025

### Overview
Enhanced the transaction sorting logic within policy term groups to create a more logical and consistent flow that follows the natural policy lifecycle. This improvement significantly reduces the time needed to understand and reconcile transactions.

### Problem Solved
Previously, transactions within policy terms were not ordered in a logical sequence, making it difficult to:
- Follow the progression of a policy
- Understand the relationship between transactions
- Quickly reconcile statements
- Identify policy changes and their impacts

### Enhanced Sort Order

#### Within Each Policy Term Group:

1. **NEW/RWL Transactions** (Policy Start)
   - NEW for first term
   - RWL for renewals
   - Always appears first to establish the policy baseline

2. **END Transactions** (Endorsements)
   - Sorted by Effective Date
   - Shows policy modifications in chronological order

3. **Other Transaction Types**
   - Groups by transaction type (CAN, STL, etc.)
   - Within each type, sorted by Effective Date
   - Maintains logical grouping of similar transactions

4. **STMT/VOID Transactions** (Payment Records)
   - **Key Enhancement**: Follows the same type ordering as regular transactions
   - NEW/RWL statements first (sorted by STMT Date)
   - END statements next (sorted by STMT Date)
   - Other type statements (grouped by type, then STMT Date)
   - Makes reconciliation more intuitive

### Benefits

1. **Logical Flow**: Transactions follow the natural policy lifecycle
2. **Consistent Patterns**: Same ordering logic applies to both regular and payment transactions
3. **Faster Reconciliation**: Easier to match statements with their corresponding transactions
4. **Reduced Complexity**: No need to jump around to understand transaction relationships

### Technical Implementation

#### Key Changes:
1. **Transaction ID Pattern Matching**: STMT/VOID transactions are identified by their Transaction ID pattern (`-STMT-` or `-VOID-`) rather than relying on the Transaction Type field, which may inherit values from parent transactions

2. **Sort Key System**: 
   - Sort Key 1: Regular NEW/RWL transactions (always first)
   - Sort Key 2: Regular END transactions
   - Sort Key 3: Other regular transactions (CAN, STL, etc.)
   - Sort Key 4: STMT/VOID with NEW/RWL type
   - Sort Key 5: STMT/VOID with END type
   - Sort Key 6: Other STMT/VOID transactions

3. **Unified Sorting Algorithm**: 
   - Single sort operation using multiple criteria
   - Sort by: sort key ‚Üí date ‚Üí transaction type ‚Üí transaction ID
   - Guarantees NEW always appears before END, even with identical dates
   - Eliminated complex DataFrame splitting and concatenation

### Example Output
```
1.1  üìÑ  NEW     Customer A  Policy123  (Original policy)
1.2  ‚úèÔ∏è  END     Customer A  Policy123  (Endorsement 1)
1.3  ‚úèÔ∏è  END     Customer A  Policy123  (Endorsement 2)
1.4  üí∞  NEW-STMT  Customer A  Policy123  (Statement for NEW)
1.5  üí∞  END-STMT  Customer A  Policy123  (Statement for END 1)
1.6  üí∞  END-STMT  Customer A  Policy123  (Statement for END 2)
=    SUBTOTAL
```

### User Guidance
The sort order is clearly documented in the "Tips for Better Navigation" section, helping users understand:
- The logic behind the ordering
- How to interpret the transaction flow
- The relationship between transactions and their payments

This enhancement makes the Policy Revenue Ledger Reports significantly more user-friendly and reduces the cognitive load required to understand complex policy histories.

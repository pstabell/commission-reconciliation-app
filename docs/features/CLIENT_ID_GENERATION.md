# Client ID Generation Feature

## Overview

The Client ID Generation feature ensures all transactions in the system have proper client identification, which is essential for accurate client-based reporting and maintaining data integrity.

## Feature Description

### Automatic Generation in Add New Policy
- When creating a new policy transaction, the system automatically generates a unique Client ID if one is not provided
- Format: `CL-XXXXXXXX` (8 random alphanumeric characters following the "CL-" prefix)
- Generated during form submission, ensuring all new transactions have proper identification

### Manual Generation in Edit Transaction Form
- For existing transactions that are missing Client IDs (created before the field was required)
- A "Generate Client ID" button appears when the Client ID field is empty
- Clicking the button:
  - Generates a unique Client ID in the same format
  - Updates the database immediately without requiring form save
  - Updates the UI to show the new ID
  - Button disappears after successful generation

## Technical Implementation

### ID Generation Logic
```python
def generate_client_id():
    """Generate a unique Client ID"""
    while True:
        # Generate 8 random alphanumeric characters
        client_id = 'CL-' + ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, k=8))
        
        # Check if this ID already exists
        existing = supabase.table('policies').select('Client ID').eq('Client ID', client_id).execute()
        
        if not existing.data:
            return client_id
```

### Edit Form Integration
- The Generate button is conditionally rendered based on whether the Client ID field is empty
- Uses Streamlit's session state to track the current transaction data
- Performs real-time database update using Supabase API
- Synchronizes session state to ensure UI consistency

### Database Update
- Updates are performed immediately when the Generate button is clicked
- No need to save the entire form - the Client ID is persisted right away
- Ensures data integrity by checking for uniqueness before saving

## User Experience

### Visual Flow
1. User opens Edit Transaction form
2. If Client ID is empty, a blue "Generate Client ID" button appears next to the field
3. User clicks the button
4. System generates unique ID and updates database
5. Field is populated with new ID
6. Button disappears

### Benefits
- Ensures all transactions have proper client identification
- Maintains backward compatibility for older transactions
- Simple one-click solution for users
- No risk of duplicate Client IDs
- Immediate persistence prevents data loss

## Implementation Locations

### Edit Policy Transactions Page
- Available in the inline edit form when viewing all policy transactions
- Appears for any transaction with an empty Client ID field

### Modal Edit Forms
- Also available in modal popups throughout the application
- Consistent behavior across all edit contexts

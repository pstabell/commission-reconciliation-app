---

## System Design

### Scope
The formula system covers two types of field locking:

1. **Formula Fields** (Primary Focus)
   - Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM) - Always calculated
   - Agent Estimated Comm $ - Always calculated

2. **Reconciliation Transaction Protection** (Security Requirement)
   - All fields in -STMT- transactions
   - All fields in -VOID- transactions
   - All fields in -ADJ- transactions

Both use consistent visual styling (#F5F5F5 background, #666666 text).

### Formula Specifications

#### Formula #1: Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)
**Purpose**: Calculate the gross commission the agency receives from the carrier  
**Formula**: `Commissionable Premium √ó Policy Gross Comm % = Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)`  
**Note**: Updated to use Commissionable Premium (Premium Sold - Policy Taxes & Fees)  
**Example**: $9,500 √ó 10% = $950

#### Formula #2: Agent Estimated Comm $
**Purpose**: Calculate the agent's portion of the commission  
**Formula**: `Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM) √ó Agent Comm Rate = Agent Estimated Comm $`  

**Agent Comm Rate Logic**:
- NEW, NBS, STL, BoR: 50%
- RWL, REWRITE: 25%
- END, PCH: 50% if new business, 25% if renewal
- CAN, XCL: 0%

**Example**: $950 √ó 50% = $475

#### Formula #3: Policy Balance Due
**Purpose**: Track outstanding commission owed to agent  
**Formula**: `Agent Estimated Comm $ - Agent Paid Amount (STMT) = Policy Balance Due`  
**Example**: $475 - $200 = $275

#### Formula #4: Commissionable Premium (NEW)
**Purpose**: Calculate the premium amount eligible for commission (excluding taxes/fees)  
**Formula**: `Premium Sold - Policy Taxes & Fees = Commissionable Premium`  
**Example**: $10,000 - $500 = $9,500

#### Formula #5: Broker Fee Agent Commission (NEW)
**Purpose**: Calculate agent's portion of broker fee (always 50%)  
**Formula**: `Broker Fee √ó 0.50 = Broker Fee Agent Comm`  
**Example**: $250 √ó 0.50 = $125  
**Note**: Broker fee commission is always 50% regardless of transaction type

#### Formula #6: Total Agent Commission (NEW)
**Purpose**: Calculate total commission including broker fee portion  
**Formula**: `Agent Estimated Comm $ + Broker Fee Agent Comm = Total Agent Comm`  
**Example**: $475 + $125 = $600

### Visual Design

#### Edit Policies Data Table
- Locked columns with light gray background (#F5F5F5)
- Darker gray text (#666666) to indicate non-editable
- Lock icon (üîí) in column header
- Tooltip on hover: "Calculated field - Formula: [formula]"

#### Add/Edit Policy Forms
- Display-only fields with gray background
- Show calculated value in real-time as inputs change
- Formula displayed below field
- No input cursor or interaction

## Implementation Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Critical Security Fix (COMPLETED - July 6, 2025)

#### Objectives
Lock all reconciliation transactions to prevent accidental edits that could compromise reconciliation integrity.

#### Implementation Details
1. **Helper Function Added**:
   ```python
   def is_reconciliation_transaction(transaction_id):
       """Check if transaction is a reconciliation entry that should be locked."""
       if not transaction_id:
           return False
       transaction_id_str = str(transaction_id)
       reconciliation_types = ['-STMT-', '-VOID-', '-ADJ-']
       return any(suffix in transaction_id_str for suffix in reconciliation_types)
   ```

2. **Column Detection Enhancement** (Critical Bug Fix):
   - Three-method detection approach for "Transaction ID" column
   - Primary: Column mapper lookup
   - Secondary: Common variations check (8 patterns)
   - Fallback: Normalized string matching

3. **Protection Features**:
   - Filters reconciliation transactions from Edit Policies page
   - Shows count split: "X editable transactions" + "Y reconciliation entries"
   - Prevents deletion of reconciliation entries
   - Blocks editing through form interface

#### Results
- Zero ability to edit reconciliation transactions
- Clear communication about locked transactions
- Visual clarity between editable and locked entries
- Maintained normal operations for regular transactions

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Formula Implementation (COMPLETED - July 6, 2025)

#### What Was Implemented
1. **Formula fields are read-only** (disabled in forms)
2. **Values calculate automatically** based on inputs
3. **Tooltips show formulas** with actual values
4. **Manual entry prevented** in calculated fields
5. **Handles agent rate** as decimal (0.50) or percentage (50%)

#### Technical Implementation
```python
def calculate_agency_commission(premium_sold, gross_comm_pct):
    """Calculate agency commission from premium and rate."""
    try:
        premium = float(premium_sold or 0)
        rate = float(gross_comm_pct or 0)
        return premium * (rate / 100)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return 0.0

def calculate_agent_commission(agency_commission, transaction_type, is_new_business=True):
    """Calculate agent commission based on agency commission and transaction type."""
    try:
        agency_comm = float(agency_commission or 0)
        
        # Determine agent rate based on transaction type
        agent_rates = {
            'NEW': 0.50, 'NBS': 0.50, 'STL': 0.50, 'BoR': 0.50,
            'RWL': 0.25, 'REWRITE': 0.25,
            'CAN': 0.00, 'XCL': 0.00
        }
        
        # Special handling for END/PCH
        if transaction_type in ['END', 'PCH']:
            rate = 0.50 if is_new_business else 0.25
        else:
            rate = agent_rates.get(transaction_type, 0.50)
            
        return agency_comm * rate
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return 0.0
```

## Technical Details

### Database Layer
- Columns remain in database for performance and reporting
- Optional database trigger to enforce formula on insert/update
- Create view with calculated columns as backup verification

### Application Layer

#### Column Configuration
```python
column_config = {
    "Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
        "Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM) üîí",
        help="Formula: Premium Sold √ó Policy Gross Comm %",
        disabled=True,
        format="$%.2f"
    ),
    "Agent Estimated Comm $": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
        "Agent Estimated Comm $ üîí",
        help="Formula: Agency Comm √ó Agent Rate",
        disabled=True,
        format="$%.2f"
    )
}
```

#### Real-time Calculation Triggers
- When Premium Sold or Gross Comm % changes: Recalculate both fields
- When Transaction Type changes: Recalculate Agent Estimated Comm only

### CSS Styling
```css
/* Locked formula fields */
.formula-field {
    background-color: #F5F5F5 !important;
    color: #666666 !important;
    cursor: not-allowed !important;
}
```

## Issues & Resolutions

### Issue #1: Column Detection Failure (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Reconciliation protection failed because column detection couldn't find "Transaction ID" (with space).

**Root Cause**: Code searched for columns containing both "transaction" AND "id" (lowercase), which failed for "Transaction ID".

**Solution**: Implemented three-method detection:
1. Column mapper lookup
2. Common variations check
3. Normalized string matching

**Impact**: All reconciliation transactions are now properly protected.

### Issue #2: Agent Commission Calculation Error (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Agent commission calculated incorrectly (e.g., $1.81 instead of $180.78).

**Root Cause**: System stored agent commission rates as decimals (0.50) but calculation expected percentages (50).

**Solution**: Added conversion logic:
```python
# If agent_comm_rate is less than 1, assume it's a decimal and convert
if agent_comm_rate > 0 and agent_comm_rate < 1:
    agent_comm_rate = agent_comm_rate * 100
```

**Impact**: All agent commission calculations now produce correct results.

### Issue #3: Streamlit Form Limitations (ACKNOWLEDGED)

**Limitation**: Forms don't update in real-time; calculations only happen on form submission.

**Workaround**: Calculations occur when form loads and when submitted. Clear user messaging explains this behavior.

## Migration Strategy

### Prerequisites
1. ‚úÖ Phase 0: Reconciliation protection (COMPLETED)
2. ‚úÖ Phase 1: Formula field implementation (COMPLETED)
3. ‚è≥ Testing of formula calculations (IN PROGRESS)
4. ‚è≥ User acceptance of formula logic (PENDING)

### Migration Process

#### Step 1: Pre-Migration Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN "Premium Sold" IS NULL OR "Premium Sold" = 0 THEN 1 END) as missing_premium,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN "Policy Gross Comm %" IS NULL OR "Policy Gross Comm %" = 0 THEN 1 END) as missing_comm_rate,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN "Transaction Type" IS NULL OR "Transaction Type" = '' THEN 1 END) as missing_trans_type
FROM policies;
```

#### Step 2: Backup Current Values
Create backup table with current values and calculated differences for rollback capability.

#### Step 3: Update All Records
1. Set reconciliation entries to $0.00
2. Calculate agency commissions for all records
3. Calculate agent commissions based on transaction type

### Expected Outcomes
1. All reconciliation entries: $0.00 in both columns
2. Missing data records: $0.00 (easy to identify)
3. Valid records: Calculated values matching formulas exactly
4. 100% formula coverage with no legacy values

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Possibilities
1. **Custom Formulas**: User-defined calculation rules
2. **Formula History**: Track when formulas change
3. **What-If Analysis**: Test different scenarios
4. **Bulk Recalculation**: Tools for rate changes

### Advanced Features
1. **Tiered Commissions**: Volume-based rate structures
2. **Bonus Calculations**: Performance incentives
3. **Split Commissions**: Multiple agents per policy
4. **Override Approval**: Workflow for exceptions

---

## Benefits & Impact

### Data Quality Improvements
1. **100% Accuracy**: No manual calculation errors
2. **Consistency**: Every record follows the same rules
3. **Transparency**: Formulas are visible and documented
4. **Efficiency**: No time spent double-checking math

### User Experience
1. **Clear Visual Cues**: Locked fields are obviously different
2. **Real-time Feedback**: See calculations update instantly
3. **Helpful Documentation**: Formulas explained in context
4. **Reduced Confusion**: No wondering why values don't match

### Audit & Compliance
1. **Traceable Calculations**: Can always verify the math
2. **No Override Capability**: Prevents accidental or intentional errors
3. **Historical Accuracy**: Past calculations remain correct
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Consistent application of commission rules

---

## Important Considerations

### Edge Cases
1. **Null/Empty Values**: Treat as zero in calculations
2. **Percentage Format**: Handle both 10 and 0.10 as 10%
3. **Negative Values**: Allow for adjustments/chargebacks
4. **Decimal Precision**: Always round to 2 decimal places

### Performance Optimization
1. **Calculate on Save**: Store calculated values in database
2. **Recalculate on Edit**: Only when component fields change
3. **Batch Operations**: Efficient updates for bulk changes
4. **Index Key Fields**: Ensure premium, rates are indexed

---

## Upcoming Enhancement: Broker Fees and Tax Separation

### Overview
The formula system will be enhanced to handle broker fees and separate non-commissionable taxes/fees from premiums.

### New Fields
1. **Broker Fee**: Fee charged directly by agency (100% retained)
2. **Policy Taxes & Fees**: Combined non-commissionable amounts
3. **Commissionable Premium**: Premium minus taxes/fees (calculated)
4. **Broker Fee Agent Comm**: Agent's 50% of broker fee (calculated)
5. **Total Agent Comm**: Combined commission including broker fee (calculated)

### Updated Calculation Flow
1. User enters: Premium Sold, Policy Taxes & Fees, Broker Fee
2. System calculates: Commissionable Premium = Premium Sold - Policy Taxes & Fees
3. Agency commission based on Commissionable Premium (not gross)
4. Agent receives standard commission PLUS 50% of broker fee
5. Total Agent Comm combines both commission streams

### Key Business Rules
- Broker fee commission is ALWAYS 50% regardless of transaction type
- Taxes and fees are NEVER commissionable
- All existing commission rate logic remains unchanged
- Formulas 1 and 2 updated to use Commissionable Premium

### Implementation Status
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Complete (see BROKER_FEES_AND_TAXES.md)
- Configuration: ‚úÖ Complete (column_mapping_config.py updated)
- Formula Engine: ‚úÖ Complete (calculations use Commissionable Premium)
- UI Updates: ‚úÖ Complete (Add/Edit forms updated)
- Database Schema: ‚è≥ Pending (SQL provided in BROKER_FEES_AND_TAXES.md)

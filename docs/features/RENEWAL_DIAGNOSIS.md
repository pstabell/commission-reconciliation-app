# Renewal Diagnosis for Transaction I0Y68NM

## Issue Summary
Transaction I0Y68NM is still showing in Pending Renewals after implementing the fix for policy renewal tracking.

## Analysis

### From SQL Export Data
Based on the SQL export (line 207), we found:
- **Transaction ID**: 4W014EN
- **Customer**: Starr Window Tinting LLC
- **Policy Number**: 321B210596
- **Transaction Type**: NEW
- **Effective Date**: 06/19/2024
- **X-DATE**: 06/19/2025

### Key Questions
1. **What is the Policy Number for transaction I0Y68NM?**
2. **Does 4W014EN have I0Y68NM's Policy Number in its "Prior Policy Number" field?**
3. **Are these two transactions related at all?**

### How the Pending Renewals Logic Works

The `get_pending_renewals` function filters out renewed policies by:
1. Finding all policies expiring within 60 days
2. Getting all policy numbers that appear in any "Prior Policy Number" field
3. Excluding policies whose Policy Number is in that list

```python
# Get list of policy numbers that have been renewed
renewed_policies = df[df[prior_policy_col].notna()][prior_policy_col].unique()
# Exclude these from pending renewals
pending_renewals = pending_renewals[~pending_renewals["Policy Number"].isin(renewed_policies)]
```

### Possible Causes

1. **Missing Prior Policy Number**: The renewal transaction (possibly 4W014EN or another) doesn't have the Prior Policy Number field populated with I0Y68NM's Policy Number.

2. **Different Policy Numbers**: I0Y68NM and its renewal might have completely different Policy Numbers, and the renewal wasn't properly linked via Prior Policy Number.

3. **Transaction Not Found**: I0Y68NM might not exist in the current database.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Check I0Y68NM Details**: Query the database to get the full details of transaction I0Y68NM, especially its Policy Number.

2. **Find Related Renewals**: Search for any transactions with:
   - Same customer as I0Y68NM
   - Transaction Type = "RWL"
   - Effective Date after I0Y68NM's X-DATE

3. **Verify Prior Policy Number**: For any potential renewals found, check if their "Prior Policy Number" field contains I0Y68NM's Policy Number.

4. **Manual Fix if Needed**: If a renewal exists but Prior Policy Number wasn't set, update it manually:
   ```sql
   UPDATE policies 
   SET "Prior Policy Number" = '[I0Y68NM Policy Number]'
   WHERE "Transaction ID" = '[Renewal Transaction ID]';
   ```

### Test Code to Add to App

```python
# Add this to a debug section of your app
st.header("Debug: Check Specific Transaction")

trans_id = st.text_input("Transaction ID:", value="I0Y68NM")
if st.button("Check"):
    df = load_policies_data()
    
    # Find the transaction
    trans = df[df["Transaction ID"] == trans_id]
    if not trans.empty:
        row = trans.iloc[0]
        st.write(f"**Found:** {row['Customer']} - Policy: {row['Policy Number']}")
        st.write(f"**Type:** {row['Transaction Type']} - Expires: {row['X-DATE']}")
        
        # Check for renewals
        policy_num = row['Policy Number']
        renewals = df[df["Prior Policy Number"] == policy_num]
        
        if renewals.empty:
            st.error(f"No renewals found with Prior Policy Number = {policy_num}")
            
            # Look for potential renewals
            customer_policies = df[
                (df['Customer'] == row['Customer']) & 
                (df['Transaction Type'] == 'RWL') &
                (df['Transaction ID'] != trans_id)
            ]
            
            if not customer_policies.empty:
                st.warning("Potential renewals found without Prior Policy Number set:")
                st.dataframe(customer_policies[['Transaction ID', 'Policy Number', 'Prior Policy Number', 'Effective Date']])
        else:
            st.success(f"Found {len(renewals)} renewal(s)")
            st.dataframe(renewals[['Transaction ID', 'Policy Number', 'Prior Policy Number', 'Effective Date']])
    else:
        st.error(f"Transaction {trans_id} not found")
```

## Conclusion

The most likely issue is that the renewal transaction for I0Y68NM exists but doesn't have the Prior Policy Number field populated. This would cause I0Y68NM to still appear in Pending Renewals even though it has been renewed.

To fix this permanently:
1. Ensure all renewal transactions have Prior Policy Number populated
2. Consider adding validation in the renewal process to require Prior Policy Number for RWL transactions
3. Add a data cleanup routine to identify and fix orphaned renewals

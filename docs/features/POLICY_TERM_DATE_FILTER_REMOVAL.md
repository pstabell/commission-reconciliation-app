# Policy Term Date Filter Removal

## Date: August 8, 2025

## Overview
Modified the policy term boundary logic to include ALL transactions for a policy regardless of their dates, removing the previous date-based filtering that restricted transactions to specific term boundaries.

## Changes Made

### 1. Policy Revenue Ledger Reports - Detailed Transactions View (Lines 14640-14658)
**Previous Behavior:**
- Filtered transactions based on term dates (term_eff_date to term_x_date)
- NEW/RWL transactions only included if in selected month
- END transactions only included if within term dates
- STMT/VOID transactions only included if within term dates or matching term effective date
- Other transactions only included if within term dates

**New Behavior:**
- ALL transactions for the policy are included regardless of dates
- No date filtering applied
- Simple inclusion of all rows

### 2. Policy Revenue Ledger Page - Term Filter (Lines 13432-13438)
**Previous Behavior:**
- Filtered policy rows based on transaction type and dates
- STMT/VOID included only if within term dates
- END included only if within term dates
- Complex date boundary checking

**New Behavior:**
- ALL transactions included when a specific term is selected
- No date filtering applied

### 3. Policy Revenue Ledger Reports - Term Grouping (Lines 15664-15668)
**Previous Behavior:**
- Complex logic to assign transactions to terms based on dates
- Different rules for NEW/RWL, END, STMT/VOID, and other transaction types
- Date boundary checking for each transaction type

**New Behavior:**
- ALL transactions for a policy are assigned to the term group
- No date-based filtering or assignment logic

## Impact

### Benefits:
1. **Complete Transaction Visibility**: Users can now see ALL transactions associated with a policy, regardless of when they occurred
2. **Simplified Logic**: Removed complex date boundary calculations and checks
3. **No Missing Transactions**: Eliminates the possibility of transactions being excluded due to date mismatches

### Considerations:
1. **Term Grouping**: When viewing a specific term, users will see all transactions for the entire policy, not just those within the term dates
2. **Month Filtering**: The month selection will still find policies with NEW/RWL in that month, but will show all transactions for those policies
3. **Data Volume**: May show more transactions than before, which could impact performance for policies with many transactions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with policies that have multiple terms
2. Verify all transactions appear when selecting specific terms
3. Check that month filtering still works for finding policies
4. Verify performance with policies having many transactions
5. Ensure no transactions are duplicated in the display

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, restore the original behavior by copying the backup file:
```bash

# 🔐 Security Design & Management Guide

**Created**: July 4, 2025  
**Purpose**: Security implementation guide and password management procedures

## 🏗️ Current Security Architecture

### Application-Level Security
- **Password Protection**: Single password for all users
- **Session Management**: Password persists across pages until logout
- **Environment Variables**: Credentials stored in `.env` (local) and Secrets (cloud)

### Credential Storage Locations

#### Local Development (.env file)
```
APP_PASSWORD=YourPasswordHere
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

#### Streamlit Cloud (Secrets)
- Access via: App Settings → Secrets
- Format: TOML (no quotes around keys)
- Updates take effect immediately

## 🔄 How to Change Passwords

### Step 1: Update Local Password
1. Edit `.env` file
2. Change only the value after `APP_PASSWORD=`
3. **Remove any example comments** - only one APP_PASSWORD line should exist
4. Save the file

### Step 2: Restart Local App
```bash
# Stop app (Ctrl+C)
# Start app again
streamlit run commission_app.py
```
**Important**: Environment variables load at startup - MUST restart!

### Step 3: Update Live App Password
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/
2. Find your app → Click "..." → Settings
3. Go to Secrets section
4. Update the APP_PASSWORD value
5. Click Save (app auto-restarts)

### Step 4: Test Both Environments
- Local: http://localhost:8501
- Live: Your Streamlit Cloud URL

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Use strong passwords (14+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)  
✅ Change passwords regularly (monthly recommended)  
✅ Keep `.env` in `.gitignore` (never commit passwords)  
✅ Use different passwords for different environments  
✅ Test password changes immediately  

### DON'T:
❌ Share passwords in chat or email  
❌ Commit `.env` files to Git  
❌ Use example/default passwords in production  
❌ Leave debug password displays in code  
❌ Store passwords in plain text files  

## 🚨 If Credentials Are Exposed

### For App Password:
1. Change password immediately in both `.env` and Streamlit Cloud
2. Restart local app
3. Verify no unauthorized access occurred

### For Supabase Keys:
1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Settings → API → Regenerate keys
3. Update `.env` file with new keys
4. Update Streamlit Cloud Secrets
5. Restart all environments

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Password Issues

### "Password not working" - Local App
1. Check `.env` has only ONE `APP_PASSWORD=` line
2. Remove any duplicate entries or comments
3. Restart the app (Ctrl+C then run again)
4. Clear Streamlit cache: `streamlit cache clear`

### "Password not working" - Live App
1. Verify Secrets format in Streamlit Cloud (TOML format)
2. Check for typos or extra spaces
3. Wait 30 seconds for changes to propagate
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)

### Debug Mode (Temporary)
Add to code to see what password app expects:
```python
st.write(f"DEBUG: Password starts with: {correct_password[:3]}")
```
**Remember to remove after debugging!**

## 📋 Quick Reference

| Environment | Password Location | Format | Restart Required |
|-------------|------------------|--------|------------------|
| Local | `.env` file | `APP_PASSWORD=value` | Yes - always |
| Streamlit Cloud | Settings → Secrets | TOML format | No - automatic |

## 🔮 Future Security Enhancements

### Phase 2 Considerations:
- Multi-user authentication with individual accounts
- Role-based access control (admin vs viewer)
- Password complexity requirements
- Password change enforcement
- Login attempt limiting
- Two-factor authentication

### Database Security:
- Row Level Security (RLS) - ready but not enabled
- API key rotation schedule
- Encrypted connections only

---

**Remember**: Security is only as strong as your weakest password. Change them regularly!# Security Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

**Date**: July 4, 2025
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION

## ✅ What We Implemented

### Basic Password Protection
1. **Added password authentication** to the Streamlit app
2. **Password is required** before any content is displayed
3. **Session-based authentication** - password persists across page changes
4. **Logout functionality** - button in sidebar to log out

### How It Works
- Password check happens at the start of `main()` function
- Password is stored in `.env` file as `APP_PASSWORD`
- Password has been changed from default (secure)
- Session state tracks authentication status
- Logout button clears session and requires re-authentication
- Fixed session state errors with proper key checking

## 🔐 Current Security Status

### What's Protected
- ✅ Web interface requires password
- ✅ No content visible without authentication
- ✅ Session persists until logout or browser close

### What's Still Vulnerable
- ⚠️ Database credentials still in app code
- ⚠️ Anyone with Supabase credentials can bypass app
- ⚠️ No user roles or permissions
- ⚠️ Password is plain text (should be hashed)
- ⚠️ No password complexity requirements

## 📝 Production Deployment

### Streamlit Cloud
1. **App is live** at your Streamlit Cloud URL
2. **Environment secrets configured** in app settings
3. **Dependencies updated** - openpyxl added to requirements.txt
4. **TOML format** for secrets (no comments, proper indentation)

### Testing Production
1. **Access the live URL**
2. **Login required** - enter your secure password
3. **Full functionality** - all features work as in local
4. **Logout available** - in sidebar menu

## ⚡ Actions Completed

### 1. ✅ Changed the Password
- Password updated from default
- Secure password in use
- Updated in both local and production environments

### 2. ✅ Tested From Different Devices
- Tested from multiple computers
- Password protection confirmed working
- Wrong passwords properly rejected

### 3. Consider Password Requirements
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of upper/lowercase letters
- Include numbers and symbols
- No dictionary words

## 🚀 Next Steps (When Ready)

### Option A: Enhanced Password Security
- Store password hash instead of plain text
- Add password complexity validation
- Implement password change functionality

### Option B: Multi-User Authentication
- Use streamlit-authenticator library
- Create multiple user accounts
- Add user roles (admin, viewer)

### Option C: Enable RLS
- Now that app is protected, consider RLS
- Start with one table at a time
- Test thoroughly after each change

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **Password in .env file**: Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
2. **Browser sessions**: Users stay logged in until they close browser or click logout
3. **Multiple users**: All users share the same password currently
4. **No user tracking**: We don't know who's logged in

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

- [x] Password protection implemented
- [x] Logout functionality added
- [x] Session management working
- [ ] Change default password
- [ ] Test from multiple devices/networks
- [ ] Consider enhanced authentication

## 💡 Quick Implementation Example

```python
# Basic password protection to implement first thing:
import streamlit as st
import hashlib
import os

def check_password():
    """Returns True if the user had the correct password."""
    
    def password_entered():
        """Checks whether a password entered by the user is correct."""
        if hashlib.sha256(st.session_state["password"].encode()).hexdigest() == os.getenv("APP_PASSWORD_HASH"):
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = True
            del st.session_state["password"]  # Don't store password
        else:
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = False

    if "password_correct" not in st.session_state:
        # First run, show input
        st.text_input("Password", type="password", on_change=password_entered, key="password")
        return False
    elif not st.session_state["password_correct"]:
        # Password not correct, show input + error
        st.text_input("Password", type="password", on_change=password_entered, key="password")
        st.error("😕 Password incorrect")
        return False
    else:
        # Password correct
        return True

# At the start of your app:
if not check_password():
    st.stop()  # Do not continue if password is wrong
```

## 📌 Important Notes
- Current status: App is web-accessible with NO authentication
- Database has NO Row Level Security (all tables)
- Supabase credentials are in the application code
- Multiple users access from different networks

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Priority
1. Start with basic password protection (Quick Win)
2. Test thoroughly
3. Then proceed to more robust authentication
4. Document all changes for team

## 💭 Questions to Consider
- How many users need access?
- Do different users need different permissions?
- Should we track who makes what changes?
- How often should passwords be rotated?
- Do we need audit trails for compliance?

## More Examples

### Example 2: Policy with Cancellation

**Policy**: ABC123
**Term**: January 2025 - January 2026

When viewing **January 2025**:
```
Transaction ID      Type    Effective Date    Description
Q7BGC6W            NEW     01/15/2025        New policy

T0EJF9Z-STMT       STMT    04/15/2025        Cancellation refund
```
All these appear because they belong to the term that STARTED in January 2025.

### Example 3: Policy with Multiple Endorsements

**Policy**: XYZ789
**Term**: June 2024 - June 2025

When viewing **June 2024**:
```
Transaction ID      Type    Effective Date    Description
U1FKG0A            NEW     06/01/2024        New policy
V2GLH1B            END     06/15/2024        Add vehicle
W3HMI2C            END     08/20/2024        Change coverage
X4INJ3D            END     11/10/2024        Add driver
Y5JOK4E-STMT       STMT    Monthly           Multiple payment entries
```

When viewing **June 2025** (if renewed):
```
Transaction ID      Type    Effective Date    Description
Z6KPL5F            RWL     06/01/2025        Renewal only
```
The renewal term starts fresh - previous term's endorsements don't carry over.

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Term-Based, Not Policy-Based**: We show complete terms, not complete policies
2. **NEW/RWL Define Terms**: These transactions mark the beginning of a term
3. **Strict Month Matching**: NEW/RWL must occur in the selected month to appear
4. **Complete Term Data**: Once a term qualifies, ALL its transactions appear
5. **No Cross-Term Bleeding**: Terms are isolated from each other

## Common Misunderstandings

### ‚ùå Wrong: "I selected August 2024, so I should see all August 2024 transactions"
‚úÖ Right: "I selected August 2024, so I see all transactions for terms that STARTED in August 2024"

### ‚ùå Wrong: "This policy renewed in February, why is it showing in August?"
‚úÖ Right: "The August view shows the original term (Aug-Feb), the February view shows the renewal term (Feb-Aug)"

### ‚ùå Wrong: "Some transactions are missing from my month view"
‚úÖ Right: "Those transactions belong to a term that started in a different month"

## Testing Your Understanding

**Question**: A policy starts on 12/15/2024 and renews on 06/15/2025. When viewing May 2025, what do you see?

**Answer**: Nothing for this policy. May 2025 only shows terms that START in May. The original term started in December 2024, and the renewal term starts in June 2025.

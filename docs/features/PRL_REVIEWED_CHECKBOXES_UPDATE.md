# Policy Revenue Ledger Reports - Reviewed Checkboxes Update

## Date: August 3, 2025

### Overview
Major update to the Policy Revenue Ledger Reports page to replace the Select/Hide/Review functionality with a simplified Reviewed checkbox system.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Select Column from Aggregated View
- The "Select" checkbox column is no longer shown in the "Aggregated by Policy" view
- This column was only needed for the now-removed bulk actions (Hide Selected, Mark as Reviewed)

#### 2. Converted Select to Reviewed Checkbox in Detailed View
- Replaced the "Select" checkbox column with a "Reviewed" checkbox column
- Removed the separate text-based "Reviewed" column that showed âœ“ marks
- Users can now directly check/uncheck items to mark them as reviewed

#### 3. Removed All Hidden Transaction Functionality
- Completely removed the hidden transactions feature
- Removed all related UI elements (View Hidden Transactions button, hidden tables)
- Removed session state variables related to hidden rows
- Everything is now handled through the Reviewed checkboxes

#### 4. Fixed Technical Issues
- **Constant Rerun Issue**: Fixed the app constantly refreshing by properly handling data_editor state changes
- **Checkbox Functionality**: Resolved issues with checkboxes being disabled or showing as TRUE/FALSE text
- **Row Colors**: Restored visual styling while maintaining checkbox functionality:
  - Light blue background for STMT transactions
  - Light red background for VOID transactions
  - Dark gray background with white text for subtotal rows

### Technical Details

#### Session State Variables
- Removed: `prl_hidden_rows`, `prl_hidden_policies`
- Active: `prl_reviewed_policies` (for Aggregated view), `prl_transaction_reviews` (for Detailed view)

#### Key Code Changes
1. Modified data_editor to use styled dataframes while preserving checkbox functionality
2. Updated subtotal row generation to handle Reviewed column instead of Select
3. Improved change detection to only trigger reruns when actual changes occur
4. Added debug tracking system to diagnose rerun issues

### User Experience Improvements
- Simpler interface with just one checkbox column for marking items as reviewed
- Consistent behavior between Aggregated and Detailed views
- Visual row colors preserved for easy identification of transaction types
- Faster performance with reduced unnecessary reruns

### Known Limitations
- Streamlit's data_editor has limitations with combining row-level styling and editable checkboxes
- The current solution successfully works around these limitations

### Migration Notes
- Users who had hidden transactions will need to use the Reviewed checkboxes instead
- All previously hidden items are now visible and can be marked as reviewed if needed

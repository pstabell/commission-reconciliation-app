# Statement Month and X-DATE Filters

## Date: 2025-01-25

### Overview
Added powerful filtering capabilities to the Policy Revenue Ledger Reports and Policy Revenue Ledger pages to support monthly statement tracking and policy term-specific analysis.

### Feature 1: Statement Month Filter (Policy Revenue Ledger Reports)

#### Purpose
Allows users to filter policies by the month they became effective, creating monthly sales cohorts for tracking and reconciliation.

#### Location
Policy Revenue Ledger Reports → Statement Month Selection section

#### Key Features
- **Month Selection Dropdown**: Shows all available months from the data, sorted newest first
- **Display Format**: Shows as "January 2025", "February 2025", etc.
- **Smart Counting**: Shows count of policies/transactions for selected month
- **Month-Specific Balance**: Displays total balance due for that month's cohort
- **Export Integration**: Selected month included in report metadata

#### How It Works
1. Filters by Effective Date to show policies that became effective in the selected month
2. Includes NEW, END, and RWL transactions effective in that month
3. Each endorsement appears in its own effective month
4. Perfect for creating monthly sales statements

#### Use Cases
- Track "What did I sell in January 2025?"
- Monitor payment progress for monthly cohorts
- Create month-specific statements for employers
- Separate business by when it became effective

### Feature 2: X-DATE Filter (Policy Revenue Ledger - Individual)

#### Purpose
Allows filtering of transaction history to show only a specific policy term, perfect for disputes and term-specific reconciliation.

#### Location
Policy Revenue Ledger → Policy Term Filter section (appears after selecting a policy)

#### Key Features
- **Term Selection**: Dropdown shows all X-DATEs for the selected policy
- **"All Terms" Option**: Default view showing complete history
- **Term Display**: Shows date range (e.g., "Term: 2024-01-15 to 2025-01-15")
- **Transaction Count**: Shows number of transactions in selected term
- **Smart Filtering**: Includes relevant transactions based on type and date

#### Filtering Logic
When a specific X-DATE is selected:
1. **NEW/RWL Transactions**: With matching X-DATE
2. **END Transactions**: With Effective Date within the term period
3. **STMT/VOID/ADJ Transactions**: With STMT DATE or Transaction ID date within term
4. **Date Extraction**: Checks both STMT DATE and embedded dates in Transaction IDs

#### Benefits
- Present focused data for specific policy terms
- Calculate term-specific balances
- Support commission disputes with clear term boundaries
- Maintain access to full history when needed

### Feature 3: Additional Enhancements

#### Effective Date Column in Ledger
- Added Effective Date column to transaction ledger
- Shows when each transaction occurred
- Helps verify transactions fall within expected policy term

#### Chronological Sorting
- Ledger now sorts by Effective Date (oldest to newest)
- Natural flow from policy inception through endorsements to payments
- Missing dates appear at the bottom

#### Dynamic Table Height
- Tables adjust height based on actual row count
- Maximum 11 visible rows plus blank row
- Scrollbar appears for additional rows
- Consistent viewing experience

#### Client ID Display Fix
- Policy Details section now intelligently selects best transaction to display
- Prioritizes transactions with Client ID populated
- Shows most complete information available

### Technical Implementation

#### Statement Month Filter
```python
# Extract year-month from Effective Date
working_data['Year-Month'] = working_data['Effective Date'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m')
unique_months = sorted(working_data['Year-Month'].dropna().unique(), reverse=True)

# Filter by selected month
month_data = working_data[working_data['Year-Month'] == selected_ym].copy()
```

#### X-DATE Filter
```python
# Filter transactions for specific term
if trans_type in ["NEW", "RWL"] and trans_x_date == selected_xdate:
    # Include policy inception/renewal
elif trans_type == "END" and term_eff_date <= trans_eff_date <= term_x_date:
    # Include endorsements within term
elif trans_type in ["STMT", "VOID", "ADJ"]:
    # Include payments within term period
```

### Excel Update Tool Fixes
- Fixed datetime serialization for Excel dates
- Excluded calculated fields (Policy Balance Due) from updates
- Improved multi-sheet Excel handling
- Better error messages with debug information

### User Benefits
1. **Monthly Tracking**: Easy creation and monitoring of monthly sales cohorts
2. **Term-Specific Analysis**: Drill down to individual policy terms for disputes
3. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of business by effective month
4. **Improved Reconciliation**: Match payments to specific terms
5. **Complete Visibility**: See both summary and detailed views as needed

# Reconciliation History Tab Reorganization - Complete

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Reorganized Layout Structure
The "All Transactions" view in the Reconciliation History tab has been reorganized to improve user experience:

**Previous Structure:**
1. Date filter form
2. Summary metrics
3. View mode radio buttons
4. Data editor table (with checkbox selection)
5. Edit form (appeared AFTER selection at bottom)

**New Structure:**
1. Date filter form
2. Summary metrics  
3. View mode radio buttons
4. **Edit form (NOW appears BEFORE data table when transaction selected)**
5. Data editor table (moved below edit form)

### 2. Technical Implementation Details

#### Session State Management
- Added `reconciliation_edit_selected` to session state to track which transaction is being edited
- Maintains the selected transaction ID across reruns

#### Edit Form Display Logic
- The edit form now appears immediately after a transaction is selected
- Added a "Cancel" button to clear selection and hide the form
- Form appears between the header and the data table

#### User Flow Improvements
1. User selects a transaction checkbox in the data table
2. Page automatically reruns and displays the edit form at the TOP
3. User can edit fields without scrolling
4. After saving or canceling, the form disappears

### 3. Key Code Changes

1. **Added session state initialization** (line 9022-9024):
```python
if 'reconciliation_edit_selected' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.reconciliation_edit_selected = None
```

2. **Moved edit form logic** to appear before data table (lines 9026-9223)

3. **Added Cancel button** with clear functionality (lines 9037-9044)

4. **Updated selection handling** to use session state (lines 9277-9285)

### 4. Benefits Achieved

1. **No scrolling required** - Edit form appears immediately visible
2. **Better workflow** - Select → Edit → Save without navigation
3. **Clear visual hierarchy** - Edit form takes precedence when active
4. **Improved accessibility** - Important actions are above the fold

### 5. Testing Checklist

- [x] Select single transaction - edit form appears above table
- [x] Cancel button clears selection and hides form
- [x] Save functionality works correctly
- [x] Multiple selection warning still displays
- [x] Form data populates correctly

## Date: 2025-09-19

### Overview
Added two new features to improve policy auditing and reporting capabilities:
1. Balance filters in Policy Revenue Ledger Reports
2. Policy audit strategy in the Help page

### Changes Made

#### 1. Balance Filters in Policy Revenue Ledger Reports
- **Location**: Policy Revenue Ledger Reports page
- **Added**: New "Balance Filters" section after the metrics display
- **Filter Options**:
  - All Balances (default)
  - Positive Balance Only (> $0) - shows policies where agent is owed money
  - Zero Balance Only (= $0) - shows policies with no balance due
  - Negative Balance Only (< $0) - shows policies where agent was overpaid
  - Non-Zero Balance (≠ $0) - shows all policies except those with zero balance
- **Features**:
  - Filtered count display showing how many policies match the selected filter
  - Balance filter selection included in export metadata for documentation

#### 2. Policy Audit Strategy in Help Page
- **Location**: Help page > Features Guide tab

  - Strategic search suggestions
  - Red flags to look for
  - Report template recommendations
  - Export and offline work suggestions
  - Daily bite-sized approach tips

### Technical Implementation

#### Balance Filters
```python
# Added balance filter dropdown
balance_filter = st.selectbox(
    "Show policies with:",
    options=[
        "All Balances",
        "Positive Balance Only (> $0)",
        "Zero Balance Only (= $0)", 
        "Negative Balance Only (< $0)",
        "Non-Zero Balance (≠ $0)"
    ],
    index=0,
    help="Filter policies based on their balance due amount"
)

# Applied filter to working_data based on selection
if balance_filter == "Positive Balance Only (> $0)":
    working_data = working_data[working_data["Policy Balance Due"] > 0]
# ... etc for other filters
```

#### Date Format Changes
- Fixed date display to show raw YYYY-MM-DD format from database
- Removed date formatting that was converting to MM/DD/YYYY
- Updated help text to indicate correct date format
- Changed date saves to use YYYY-MM-DD format consistently

#### Edit Renewal Transaction Form
- Added 'NOTES' to the fields_to_clear list
- NOTES field now clears when creating a renewal transaction
- Prevents copying notes from the original policy

### User Benefits
1. **Improved Auditing**: Users can now focus on specific balance categories
2. **Better Documentation**: Export includes filter selection for audit trails
3. **Clear Guidance**: Help page provides structured approach to data review
4. **Consistent Dates**: All dates now display in consistent YYYY-MM-DD format
5. **Clean Renewals**: NOTES don't carry over to renewal transactions

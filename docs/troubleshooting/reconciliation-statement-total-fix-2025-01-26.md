# Reconciliation Statement Total Fix - January 26, 2025

## Issue Description
User reported that reconciliation is showing incorrect statement total:
- Expected: $1,568.68 (from statement)
- Displayed: $3,179.13 (incorrect)
- Debug script shows the issue is related to "Total Agent Comm" column

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Wrong Column Being Summed
The system was summing the "Total Agent Comm" column from the uploaded statement instead of the "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)" column. This happened because:
- The statement contains both columns
- Total Agent Comm = $3,179.13 (total commission earned)
- Agent Paid Amount = $1,568.68 (what was actually paid)

### 2. Totals Row Issue
The statement includes a totals row with value $1,568.941 that should be excluded from calculations but used for verification.

## Solution

### 1. Fix Column Mapping
Ensure the system uses "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)" for the statement total calculation, not "Total Agent Comm".

### 2. Totals Row Handling
The system already has logic to skip totals rows (lines 3144-3145 in commission_app.py):
```python
if any(total_word in customer_lower for total_word in ['total', 'totals', 'subtotal', 'sub-total', 'grand total', 'sum']):
    continue
```

### 3. Verification Display
The verification check should compare:
- Statement Total: Sum of "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)" column (excluding totals rows)
- Ready to Reconcile: Sum of matched transactions' agent paid amounts

## Implementation Notes

### Current Working Logic (from STATEMENT_IMPORT.md):
1. **Primary Purpose**: Reconcile agent's commission payments (what YOU received)
2. **Secondary Purpose**: Track agency's gross commission for audit verification
3. **Required Fields**:
   - Agent Paid Amount (STMT) - PRIMARY reconciliation field
   - Agency Comm Received (STMT) - AUDIT field

### Key Code Sections:
1. Statement total calculation (around line 11112)
2. Verification check display (lines 4601-4614)
3. Totals row exclusion (lines 3141-3149)

## Prevention
1. Always use "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)" for reconciliation totals
2. Exclude rows where customer contains "total", "totals", etc.
3. Display clear column mapping to users during import
4. Show which column is being summed for the statement total

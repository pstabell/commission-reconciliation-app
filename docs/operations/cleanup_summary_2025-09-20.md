## Overview

## 1. SQL Scripts Organization

### Created Archive Structure
- Created `/sql_scripts/archive/` directory with organized subdirectories
- Created `/sql_scripts/README.md` with categorized index of all SQL scripts
- Created `/sql_scripts/archive/ARCHIVE_LOG_2025-01-20.md` documenting all archived files

### Archived SQL Scripts by Category
- **Demo Data Scripts** (19 files): Scripts related to demo user data analysis and fixes
- **Carrier/MGA Scripts** (11 files): Scripts for carrier and MGA management
- **Duplicate Fixes** (4 files): Scripts for handling duplicate data issues
- **Export Scripts** (4 files): Data export utilities

### Maintained Active Scripts
Kept only essential, frequently-used scripts in the main `/sql_scripts/` directory:
- User system migrations
- Table creation scripts
- Active migration helpers
- Current schema definitions

## 2. Documentation Organization

### Created Archive Structure
- Created `/docs/archive/` directory with subdirectories:
  - `/docs/archive/changelogs/`: Historical changelogs (pre-2025)
  - `/docs/archive/troubleshooting/`: Resolved issues documentation
  - `/docs/archive/features/`: Superseded feature documentation
  - `/docs/archive/guides/`: Outdated guides
  - `/docs/archive/operations/`: Old operational docs

### Archived Documentation (30+ files)
- Moved all 2024 changelogs to archive
- Archived resolved troubleshooting documents
- Relocated superseded feature plans and implementations
- Preserved historical documentation for reference

### Created Organization Summary
- Created `/docs/operations/docs_organization_summary_2025-01-20.md`
- Comprehensive index of current documentation structure
- Clear categorization of all active documentation

## 3. Python Script Cleanup

### Moved to Archive
- `commission_app_20250919_204833_after_adding_comprehensive_help_system.py` → `/archive/backup_files_2025-01-20/`
- `commission_app_20250920_081239_after_fixing_edit_policy_duplicate_bug.py` → `/archive/backup_files_2025-01-20/`

### Already in Archive
- `update_demo_batch_ids.py` was already in `/archive/temp_scripts/`
- Various webhook test scripts in `/archive/temp_scripts/`

## 4. Benefits of Organization

- Logical categorization of all scripts and documentation
- Easy navigation through well-organized directories

### Better Maintenance

- Historical files preserved but out of the way

### Enhanced Documentation
- Comprehensive README files in key directories
- Archive logs documenting what was moved and why
- Organization summaries for future reference

## 5. Current Project Structure (Key Directories)

```

## 6. Recommendations for Future

1. **Regular Archiving**: Archive resolved issues and outdated documentation monthly
2. **Naming Conventions**: Continue using date-based naming for easy sorting
3. **Archive Logs**: Update archive logs when moving files
4. **Documentation**: Keep README files updated in key directories
5. **Backup Strategy**: Use dated directories in archive for backups

## Summary
This cleanup effort has significantly improved the project's organization, making it easier to navigate, maintain, and understand. All historical files have been preserved in logical archive structures while keeping the main directories focused on current, active files.

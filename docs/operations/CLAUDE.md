# CLAUDE.md - AI Development Guide & Context

This file contains important context and guidelines for AI assistants (like Claude) working on the Sales Commission App.

**Last Updated**: July 31, 2025  
**Current Version**: 3.9.18

## Quick Context
- **Language**: Python with Streamlit
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Architecture**: Single-file app (commission_app.py) - intentionally monolithic
- **Authentication**: Password-based (environment variable)
- **State Management**: Streamlit session state
- **Caching**: In-memory with manual cache clearing

## Recent Major Changes (v3.9.18)
1. **STMT Transaction Client ID Inclusion Fix**:
   - Fixed missing STMT transactions in Policy Revenue Ledger
   - STMT transactions often have missing or different Client IDs
   - Now retrieves transactions by Client ID + Policy Number
   - ALSO includes any STMT transactions matching Policy Number regardless of Client ID
   - Ensures all reconciliation entries appear under correct policy
   - Prevents orphaned STMT transactions due to Client ID mismatches

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.17)
1. **Simplified Checkbox Interface in Policy Revenue Ledger Reports**:
   - Replaced two checkbox columns (Hide, Reviewed) with single "Select" column
   - Actions determined by buttons: "Hide Selected" and "Mark as Reviewed"
   - Added "View Reviewed" button to access reviewed transactions
   - Cleaner interface with less horizontal scrolling
   - Follows common UI pattern of select-then-act

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.16)
1. **Policy Number Whitespace Fix**:
   - Fixed duplicate policy entries caused by leading/trailing spaces in policy numbers
   - STMT transaction had ' 1AA338948' (with space) vs original '1AA338948'
   - Now trims all policy numbers before comparison and grouping
   - Applied trimming in both dropdown population and transaction retrieval
   - Resolves issue where same policy appeared twice in Policy Revenue Ledger

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.15)
1. **Policy Revenue Ledger Grouping Fix**:
   - Fixed duplicate policy entries in dropdown when customer names have slight variations
   - Now groups by Client ID + Policy Number instead of relying on exact customer name matches
   - When retrieving policy transactions, uses Client ID + Policy Number to get ALL related transactions
   - Prevents splitting of policies due to punctuation differences (commas, periods, etc.)
   - Ensures STMT transactions show under the correct policy even with name mismatches

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.14)
1. **Client ID in Reconciliation Edit Form**:
   - Added Client ID as editable field in reconciliation edit form
   - Allows fixing missing Client IDs on STMT transactions directly from reconciliation page
   - Helps properly link transactions for Policy Revenue Ledger grouping
   - Shows "was: [original value]" format like other editable fields
   - Includes help text: "Enter the Client ID to properly link this transaction"

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.13)
1. **MGA Contact Info Fix**:
   - Fixed "Could not find the 'contact_name' column of 'mgas'" error
   - MGAs use JSONB contact_info column, not individual contact fields
   - Updated MGA edit form to properly save contact data to contact_info JSONB
   - Updated MGA display to read from contact_info.contact_name, etc.
   - Add MGA form already correctly used JSONB format

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.12)
1. **Policy Term Custom Default**:
   - Policy Term now defaults to "Custom" instead of auto-calculating 12 months
   - X-DATE updates immediately when Policy Term is selected (no Calculate button needed)

   - Users must explicitly choose term length for better data accuracy
   - Shows success message when X-DATE is automatically calculated
   - Fixed session state modification error by removing form callbacks (not allowed in Streamlit forms)
   - X-DATE calculation now shows info message when Policy Term is selected
   - Added help text explaining bidirectional relationship: Policy Term ‚Üí X-DATE (immediate) and X-DATE ‚Üí Policy Term (on Calculate)
   - Fixed critical issue: X-DATE no longer changes automatically when editing existing transactions
   - X-DATE only updates when user explicitly changes Policy Term value

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.11)
1. **Edit Transactions Column Order Fix**:
   - Fixed persistent column ordering in Edit Policy Transactions table
   - Column order now maintained throughout editing sessions

   - Shows error: "This batch has already been voided. You cannot void a batch twice."
   - Void reason field now has yellow styling (#fff3b0 background, #e6a800 border)
   - Matches app-wide input field styling for consistency

## Prior Major Changes (v3.9.4)
1. **Reconciliation Matching Logic Fixes**:
   - Fixed false matches where different policy numbers (TESTPOLICY123 vs TESTPOLICY001) were matched based on customer name alone
   - Now requires policy number match for automatic matching (95% confidence)
   - Customer-only matches require manual confirmation
   - "exact" label now only for 99%+ confidence matches
   - Added confidence tiers: exact, high, good, moderate, low
   - Added NaN cleaning to prevent database errors
   - Added "Skip" option for low confidence matches

## Prior Changes (v3.5.15)
1. **Client ID Matching**: New transactions from reconciliation now properly link to Client IDs
2. **Enhanced Reconciliation UI**: Clear force match warnings, improved create transaction labels
3. **Transactions Requiring Attention**: New filter on Edit Policies page for incomplete data
4. **Agency Comm Optional**: Moved to optional fields, allowing reconciliation without it
5. **Smart Warning Logic**: Only shows warnings for genuine customer name mismatches

## Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. Column Names with Spaces
**Issue**: Supabase/PostgreSQL requires quotes for columns with spaces
```python
# Wrong
supabase.table('policies').select('Transaction ID')

# Correct
supabase.table('policies').select('"Transaction ID"')
```

### 2. Timestamp Serialization
**Issue**: pandas Timestamp objects can't be JSON serialized
**Solution**: Use `convert_timestamps_for_json()` function before database operations

### 3. UI-Only Fields
**Issue**: Some fields exist only in UI, not database
**Current UI-only fields**:
- Edit, Select, Action, Details (table checkboxes)
- new_effective_date, new_expiration_date (renewal helpers)
- expiration_date (maps to X-DATE in database)
- Rate (commission rate from statement - display only)
- Days Until Expiration (calculated field)
- Status (UI display field for renewals)
- _id (internal row identifier)
**Solution**: Use `clean_data_for_database()` function before any insert operations

### 4. Date Format Standardization (REMOVED in v3.7.5)
**Standard**: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) - Streamlit's natural handling
**Note**: All date formatting overrides have been removed to let Streamlit handle dates naturally

### 5. Data Loading & Caching (v3.5.1)
**Issue**: Stale data between page navigation
**Solution**: Each page loads `all_data = load_policies_data()` independently
**Note**: Form data is safe - refresh only occurs on page load, not during form filling

### 6. Pending Renewals Display
**Issue**: `duplicate_for_renewal()` was modifying display data
**Solution**: Use `.copy()` for display, only transform when actually creating renewals
**Impact**: Transaction types now display correctly

### 7. Duplicate Form Names (FIXED in v3.5.3)
**Issue**: StreamlitDuplicateElementKey error preventing all edits
**Cause**: Two implementations of edit form with same name
**Solution**: Removed 657 lines of duplicate code, consolidated to single function
**Prevention**: Track rendered fields to avoid duplicate widget keys

### 8. Void Transactions Not Visible (FIXED in v3.5.4)
**Issue**: Voided reconciliations appeared ACTIVE in history
**Cause**: Filter only looked for `-STMT-` transactions, not `-VOID-`
**Solution**: Updated filter to include both patterns with OR condition
**Note**: Also fixed case-sensitive status comparisons (handles lowercase 'void')

### 9. Duplicate Transactions on Inline Add/Edit (FIXED in v3.5.5)
**Issue**: Editing inline-added transactions created duplicates instead of updating
**Cause**: Modal save logic only checked `_id` field which wasn't in session state
**Solution**: Added database check for existing Transaction ID before INSERT/UPDATE
**Prevention**: Modal now queries database to verify record existence

### 10. Customer Name Format Inconsistency (FIXED in v3.5.6)
**Issue**: Reconciliation created new transactions with statement name format instead of existing
**Cause**: System didn't check for existing customers when creating new transactions
**Solution**: Added customer matching before transaction creation
**Example**: "Ghosh, Susmit" from statement now uses existing "Susmit K. Ghosh"

### 11. Import Function Missing Parameter (FIXED in v3.5.7)
**Issue**: "name 'all_data' is not defined" error when clicking "Proceed with Import"
**Cause**: show_import_results function needed access to all_data but wasn't receiving it
**Solution**: Added all_data parameter to function signature and call
**Impact**: Reconciliation imports now work without errors

### 12. Voided Reconciliations Not Showing as Unreconciled (FIXED in v3.5.8)
**Issue**: Transactions remained reconciled after voiding the batch
**Cause**: calculate_transaction_balances only counted -STMT- entries, not -VOID-
**Solution**: Updated to include -VOID- entries (which have negative amounts)
**Impact**: Voided transactions now properly show as unreconciled and can be re-reconciled

### 13. Manual Match Customer Name Mismatches (FIXED in v3.5.9)
**Issue**: Cannot reconcile when customer names don't match exactly (e.g., "Last, First" vs "First Last")
**Cause**: Auto-match requires exact name matches, no manual override option
**Solution**: Added "Match transaction" checkbox for manual customer selection
**Impact**: Users can now match transactions despite name format differences

### 14. Manual Match KeyErrors (FIXED in v3.5.10)
**Issue**: KeyError 'balance' and 'Policy Number' when processing manual matches
**Cause**: Manual matches don't have all fields that automatic matches have
**Solution**: Added .get() with fallbacks for missing fields
**Impact**: Manual matching now works without errors

### 15. Missing Statement Fields (FIXED in v3.5.11)
**Issue**: KeyError 'effective_date' when statement data incomplete
**Cause**: Direct dictionary access without checking field existence
**Solution**: Use .get() with empty string defaults for all statement fields
**Impact**: Reconciliation handles incomplete statements gracefully

### 16. Void Screen Shows Agency Amounts Instead of Agent (FIXED in v3.5.12)
**Issue**: Adjustments & Voids tab showed different amounts than Reconciliation History
**Cause**: Hardcoded to use 'Agency Comm Received (STMT)' instead of 'Agent Paid Amount (STMT)'
**Solution**: Changed all void screen references to use Agent amounts
**Impact**: Void screen now shows consistent amounts with reconciliation, preventing confusion

### 17. Transactions Not Showing in Matching Dropdown (ENHANCED in v3.5.13)
**Issue**: Users report transactions with balance not appearing in reconciliation matching
**Common Causes**:
- Customer name variations (e.g., "Adam Gomes" vs "Gomes, Adam")
- Transaction has zero commission amount
- Transaction already fully reconciled
**Solution**: Added debug mode showing all customer transactions with balance calculations
**Enhanced**: Improved fuzzy customer matching with word-based algorithms
**Impact**: Users can now troubleshoot missing transactions and system handles name variations better

### 18. Column Mapping Load Not Working (FIXED in v3.5.14)
**Issue**: Saved column mappings appeared to load but dropdowns didn't update
**Cause**: Streamlit doesn't allow modifying widget state after creation
**Solution**: Use column_mapping to set selectbox index parameter on creation
**Impact**: Saved mappings now properly populate all dropdown selections

### 19. Cross-Reference Key Database Error (FIXED in v3.5.14)
**Issue**: PGRST204 error - "Could not find the 'Cross-Reference Key' column"
**Cause**: Code tried to insert field that doesn't exist in database
**Solution**: Removed Cross-Reference Key, tracking info preserved in NOTES field
**Impact**: Reconciliation imports work without database schema changes

### 20. Rate Field Database Error (FIXED in v3.5.14)
**Issue**: PGRST204 error - "Could not find the 'Rate' column of 'policies'"
**Cause**: UI-only field (Rate) was being included in database insert operations
**Solution**: Created `clean_data_for_database()` function to remove all UI-only fields before insertion
**Impact**: Import process now works without database errors, Rate still displays in UI

### 21. Missing Statement Fields KeyError (FIXED in v3.5.14)
**Issue**: KeyError 'effective_date' when processing statement data
**Cause**: Direct dictionary access without checking if fields exist
**Solution**: Updated all dictionary access to use `.get()` with safe defaults
**Impact**: Handles incomplete or missing statement data without crashing

### 22. Missing Client IDs on New Transactions (FIXED in v3.5.15)
**Issue**: New transactions created during reconciliation had no Client ID
**Cause**: System wasn't looking up or creating client records during import
**Solution**: Added client matching UI with radio buttons for existing/new clients
**Impact**: All new transactions now properly linked to Client IDs

### 23. Transactions with Missing Data (ADDRESSED in v3.5.15)
**Issue**: Transactions with payments but no premium/commission data cause incorrect reports
**Cause**: Created during reconciliation without complete information
**Solution**: Added "Show Transactions Requiring Attention" filter on Edit Policies page
**Impact**: Easy identification and completion of incomplete transaction data

### 24. Import-Created Transactions Not Protected (FIXED in v3.6.3)
**Issue**: Transactions created during import could be deleted, breaking reconciliation
**Cause**: No special identification or protection for import-created transactions
**Solution**: 
- Added -IMPORT suffix to transaction IDs (e.g., D5D19K7-IMPORT)
- Implemented partial edit restrictions (payment fields read-only)
- Added delete protection with clear error messages
- Created comprehensive explanation box in edit form
**Migration**: Updated database validation function and migrated 45 existing transactions
**Impact**: Import transactions now protected while allowing commission data completion

### 25. Search & Filter Column Name Errors (FIXED in v3.6.4)
**Issue**: KeyError: 'Transaction_ID' when using Search & Filter page
**Cause**: Code used underscore-separated column names but database has space-separated
**Solution**: Updated all column references to use correct names:
- `Transaction_ID` ‚Üí `Transaction ID`
- `Policy_Number` ‚Üí `Policy Number`
- `Client_ID` ‚Üí `Client ID`
- `Policy_Type` ‚Üí `Policy Type`
- `Transaction_Type` ‚Üí `Transaction Type`
- `Effective_Date` ‚Üí `Effective Date`
- `Commission_Paid` ‚Üí `Agent Paid Amount (STMT)`
- `Balance_Due` ‚Üí `Policy Balance Due`
**Impact**: Search & Filter functionality now works correctly

### 26. Void Transactions Using Current Date (FIXED in v3.6.5)
**Issue**: Void transactions created with current date instead of statement date
**Cause**: Date extraction only handled IMPORT- prefix, not REC- or MNL- formats
**Example**: Voiding REC-20240831-XXX created transactions with 20250715 dates
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced date extraction using regex pattern `-(\d{8})-` 
- Extracts YYYYMMDD from any batch ID format
- Sets both Transaction ID suffix and STMT DATE to statement date
**Impact**: Void transactions now appear in correct historical period

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Before Making Changes
- Always create timestamped backup of commission_app.py
- Check column_mapping_config.py for field name mappings
- Verify field exists in database before operations

### 2. Database Operations
- Use Supabase client, not raw SQL
- Quote column names with spaces
- Handle NaN values (convert to None)
- Clear cache after writes: `clear_policies_cache()`

### 3. Form Development
- Use `edit_transaction_form()` for consistency
- Preserve disabled field values manually
- Apply formula calculations on form load
- Format dates before display

### 4. Testing Renewals
Test with policy that changes numbers:
- Client: Starr Window Tinting LLC
- Original Policy: 1AA338948
- Renewed to: 277B513884
- Type: Commercial surplus lines

### 5. Common Pitfalls
- Don't assume column names match UI labels
- Check for both None and NaN values
- Remember field_counter starts at 0 for column positioning
- Transaction ID must be unique (check before insert)

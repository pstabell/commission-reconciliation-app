# User Isolation Security Model - January 2025

## Overview
Complete user data isolation implemented to prevent data loss and ensure privacy. Each user has their own carriers, MGAs, and commission rules with no shared data.

## Problem Solved
- Shared carriers/MGAs were deleted, affecting all users
- No way to track who deleted what
- Risk of users seeing each other's commission structures
- Single point of failure for reference data

## New Architecture

### Database Structure
All commission-related tables now include `user_email`:
- `carriers` - Each user has their own carrier list
- `mgas` - Each user has their own MGA list  
- `carrier_mga_relationships` - User-specific relationships
- `commission_rules` - Already had user isolation

### Security Implementation
1. **Application-Level Filtering**
   - All queries filter by `user_email = session['user_email']`
   - No reliance on RLS due to custom auth implementation
   - Production mode enforces user filtering

2. **Data Creation**
   - New records automatically tagged with user_email
   - No shared/global records possible
   - Complete isolation from other users

## Benefits
1. **Data Protection**: One user's actions can't affect others
2. **Privacy**: Users can't see each other's carriers or rates
3. **Customization**: Each user can have different names for same carrier
4. **Audit Trail**: Always know who created what

## Migration Impact
- Existing shared carriers assigned to specific users
- Each user starts fresh with their own carrier list
- No more "default" carriers for new users

## User Experience
- Users must add their own carriers/MGAs
- Can import from CSV template
- Complete control over their data
- No mysterious disappearing data

## Technical Details
```python
# Old (shared data)
carriers = db.query("SELECT * FROM carriers")

# New (user isolated)
carriers = db.query("SELECT * FROM carriers WHERE user_email = ?", user_email)
```

## Future Considerations
- Migration to user_id instead of user_email
- Bulk import tools for new users
- Template sharing between users (optional)

## Security Best Practices
1. Always include user_email in queries
2. Never create records without user_email
3. Test in production mode to ensure filtering works
4. Regular backups per user

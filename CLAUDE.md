## Policy Term Transaction Rules

- Transactions can only exist in ONE policy term to avoid duplication
- A transaction is unique and cannot physically exist in two policy terms
- Transactions falling on an X-DATE should go on the renewing policy term (Policy term 2)
- ALL transactions with an effective date within a policy term must follow consistent rules
- Master Policy Term Rules are designed to be unbreakable

### Commission Dollar Calculations

**Agent Estimated Comm $**:
```
Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM) Ã— (Agent Comm % Ã· 100)
```

**Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)**:
```
Commissionable Premium Ã— (Policy Gross Comm % Ã· 100)
```
*Note: Now uses Commissionable Premium (Premium Sold minus taxes/fees) for accurate calculations

**Policy Balance Due**:
```
Agent Estimated Comm $ - Agent Paid Amount (STMT)
```

### ðŸ†• Broker Fee & Tax Calculations

**Commissionable Premium**:
```
Premium Sold - Policy Taxes & Fees = Commissionable Premium
```

**Broker Fee Agent Commission**:
```
Broker Fee Ã— 0.50 = Broker Fee Agent Comm
```
*Note: Broker fee commission is always 50% regardless of transaction type

```

- Premium Sold: $150

### Revenue Calculation
**Agency Revenue (10% default)**:

Agency Revenue = Premium Sold Ã— 0.10
```

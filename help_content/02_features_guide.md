- Empty cells in Excel will clear those fields in database
- Only existing transactions (matched by Transaction ID)

‚ùå **What WON'T Be Updated**:
- Transaction ID itself (used for matching only)
- _id field (internal database ID)
- Calculated fields (Policy Balance Due)
- Any column not in your Excel file
- Transactions without matching IDs

**Common Errors & Solutions**:

1. **"Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable"**

2. **"Could not find the 'Policy Balance Due' column"**
   - This is a calculated field - will be skipped automatically
   - Balance recalculates when viewing reports

3. **"Column policies.TransactionID does not exist"**
   - Make sure column is named "Transaction ID" (with space)

4. **Multi-sheet Excel Issues**:
   - Tool auto-detects "Policy Revenue Report" sheet
   - Or uses last sheet if naming differs
   - Shows which sheet is being read

**Best Practices**:

1. **Always Backup First**: Export current data before bulk updates
2. **Test Small**: Try with a few records first
3. **Verify Column Names**: Must match exactly (case and spaces)
4. **Check Your Dates**: Ensure dates are in recognizable format
5. **Review Changes**: Use the preview to verify before updating

**Workflow Example**:

1. Run Policy Revenue Ledger Report
2. Export to Excel
3. Open in Excel, make corrections
4. Save file (keep Transaction ID column unchanged)
5. Upload to Update tool
6. Review preview and matching count
7. Execute update

9. Refresh reports to see updated balances

**Column Mapping Notes**:

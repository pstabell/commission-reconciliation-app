## 🚨 Phase 1: Emergency Backup Protection (Active)

Your database is now protected by a bulletproof security system designed to prevent unauthorized changes and data loss.

### 🔐 Active Protection Features

### 🔧 How It Works

1. **Startup Check**: Every app launch verifies database integrity
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time protection against unauthorized changes
3. **Metadata Backup**: Backup history is automatically protected
4. **Recovery System**: Multiple layers of backup and recovery options

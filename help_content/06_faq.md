## üì§ Import & Export Questions

### Q: How do I bulk update transactions after exporting to Excel?
**A**: Use the Update Existing Transactions tool:
1. Export your data from any report
2. Make changes in Excel (keep Transaction ID unchanged)
3. Go to Tools ‚Üí Import/Export ‚Üí Update Existing Transactions
4. Upload your modified Excel file
5. Review the preview and click Update Transactions

### Q: Will updating from Excel delete my other data?
**A**: No! The update tool:
- Only updates columns present in your Excel file
- Leaves all other columns unchanged
- Never deletes transactions
- Only updates existing records (matched by Transaction ID)

### Q: What happens to calculated fields like Policy Balance Due?
**A**: Calculated fields are:
- Automatically skipped during updates
- Recalculated when you view reports
- Not stored in the database
- Always based on current data

### Q: My Excel has multiple sheets. Which one is used?
**A**: The tool automatically:
1. Looks for "Policy Revenue Report" sheet first
2. Then searches for sheets with "report" or "policy" in the name
3. Uses the last sheet if no match found
4. Shows which sheet it's reading from

### Q: Can I change the column order in my Excel file?
**A**: Yes! Column order doesn't matter:
- Matching is done by column name, not position
- Rearrange columns however you prefer
- Just ensure column names match exactly

### Q: What if some Transaction IDs don't match?
**A**: Unmatched transactions are:
- Counted as "New/Unmatched"
- Listed in the preview
- Skipped during update (not created as new)
- Reported in the final summary

### Q: How do I know which columns will be updated?
**A**: The preview shows:
- List of columns to be updated
- Count of matching transactions
- Warning for calculated fields
- All before any changes are made

## üí∞ Commission Calculations

### Q: How are commissions calculated?
**A**: Commission calculations depend on the Transaction Type:
- **NEW business**: 50% of agency commission
- **Renewals (RWL)**: 25% of agency commission
- **Endorsements (END)**: 50% if new policy, 25% if existing
- **Cancellations (CAN)**: 0%

### Q: Why can't I edit the commission calculation fields?
**A**: These fields are automatically calculated to ensure accuracy:
- Agent Estimated Comm $
- Agency Estimated Comm/Revenue (CRM)
- Policy Balance Due

To change these values, modify the underlying data (Premium Sold, Commission %, etc.).

### Q: What does "Policy Balance Due" mean?
**A**: Policy Balance Due = Commission Owed - Amount Paid
- **Positive amount**: You haven't been paid the full commission yet
- **Zero or negative**: You've been paid in full (or overpaid)

4. Add customer filter if needed
5. Export as Excel or CSV

### Q: What's the difference between "All Policies" and "Policy Revenue Ledger"?
**A**: 
- **All Policies**: Shows all transactions as separate rows

1. Add an "Agent" or "Producer" column (Admin Panel)
2. Include agent name in policy data entry
3. Filter reports by agent name
4. Consider separate databases for completely different agents

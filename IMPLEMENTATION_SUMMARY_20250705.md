# Implementation Summary - Agent Paid Amount as Primary Field
**Date**: July 5, 2025
**Backup Created**: commission_app_20250705_225949_before_agent_paid_primary.py

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Column Mapping Updates
- **Required Fields**:
  - Changed primary required field from "Agency Comm Received (STMT)" to "Agent Paid Amount (STMT)"
  - Updated description to "Agent Payment Amount (Required)"
  
- **Optional Fields**:
  - Moved "Agency Comm Received (STMT)" to optional fields
  - Updated description to "Agency Commission (for Audit)"

### 2. Matching Logic Updates
- Modified `match_statement_transactions()` to use Agent Paid Amount as primary amount
- Added tracking of both amounts:
  - `amount`: Agent Paid Amount (primary for reconciliation)
  - `agency_amount`: Agency Comm Received (for audit purposes)

### 3. Reconciliation Entry Creation
- Updated import reconciliation to properly set both fields:
  - `Agent Paid Amount (STMT)`: Set from the agent payment amount (primary)
  - `Agency Comm Received (STMT)`: Set from agency amount when available (audit)

### 4. Reconciliation History Display
- Updated totals to show "Total Agent Payments" instead of agency amounts
- Modified batch summaries to use Agent Paid Amount for calculations
- Added both agent and agency amounts to transaction displays
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing data

## Key Concepts Preserved

1. **Dual-Purpose Reconciliation**:
   - Primary: Reconcile agent's commission payments
   - Secondary: Track agency's gross commission for audit

2. **Double-Entry Accounting**:
   - Credits: Agent Estimated Comm $ (what agent expects)
   - Debits: Agent Paid Amount (STMT) (what agent received)
   - Balance: Outstanding amount owed to agent

3. **Audit Trail**:
   - Agency Comm Received (STMT) remains available for verification
   - Helps identify commission split discrepancies

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test import with statements containing both agent and agency amounts
2. Verify totals show agent payments (not agency amounts)
3. Confirm backward compatibility with existing reconciliations
4. Test manual reconciliation still works correctly

## Future Enhancement

The last pending todo item is to add the ability to save column mappings as defaults per agency. This would streamline repeated imports from the same sources.
